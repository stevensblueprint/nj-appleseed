# Section 2: Negotiating a “Reasonable Payment Plan”

After you have verified the accuracy of the bill and how much you owe, you still might not have the funds on hand to pay it all at once.

Be aware that if you pay a medical bill with a credit card, the medical debt will lose certain legal protections that otherwise apply to it under a 2024 New Jersey law known as the [Louisa Carman Medical Debt Relief Act](https://pub.njleg.state.nj.us/Bills/2024/PL24/48_.PDF), including a 3% cap on interest and a ban on reporting such debts to credit reporting agencies. The same is true if you use financing services like CareCredit and similar medical payment cards to pay for purely cosmetic procedures, spa services or veterinary services for a pet. Also, be aware that CareCredit and some other types of medical financing might advertise promotional financing with no interest or a very low interest rate over a specific period of time, but if you fail to fully repay within that time or miss a payment, the interest might be applied and possibly at a higher rate than would ordinarily be charged. You should exercise similar caution regarding other forms of medical financing or loans that might be offered by your doctor, hospital or a third-party lender.

If it is possible for you, you might want to find some other way to pay a medical bill, such as by entering into an installment plan (discussed below) or borrowing the money from a relative or friend.

## What is a “Reasonable Payment Plan”?

Some providers currently offer payment plans. For example, Summit Medical Group, which has thousands of providers in a variety of medical specialties in five states with 170 locations in
New Jersey, offers two-month interest-free payment plans when you pay through their online
portal. If you need more time than that, they provide a phone number you can call to negotiate a longer time, though they might then charge interest.

Now, all health providers in New Jersey are required to offer a “Reasonable Payment Plan” as a result of a state law which took effect on July 22, 2025. All health care providers, including private physicians, must offer such a plan before they can start medical debt collection efforts. (Debt collector agencies are also subject to this requirement and cannot sue you prior to offering you a Reasonable Payment Plan.) These Payment Plans can last from six months to five years, possibly even longer, based on how much you owe and your ability to pay. The amount of the monthly payments cannot be greater than 3% of your individual monthly income, if known to the provider or debt collector, and the annual interest rate cannot be more than 3%.

The Payment Plan requirement extends to both insured and uninsured patients. If you are insured, the amount of the bill will depend on whether you have met your deductible, and whether your health plan requires you to pay a percentage of the charge your insurer has negotiated for the services you received. If you are uninsured, there is no prior negotiated rate and you will almost certainly be charged a higher amount than someone who is insured. Therefore, before the provider offers you a Payment Plan, you want to first try to lower the amount of the bill. Here are some possible ways to do that

## How You Can Try to Lower Your Bill

If the bill is from a hospital, they are not allowed to charge you for any services unless they first determine whether or not you are eligible for Medicaid or Charity Care, which is discussed above in Chapter 2, Section 4. If they have not done that and you think you might be eligible, you can insist that they make that determination first. You may have to prove your income using pay stubs, and/or information about government benefits, although hospitals are required to accept your certification of your monthly income if you are not employed or cannot provide certain documents.

It is possible that you need not pay any portion of a hospital bill. Even if your income is a little too high to qualify for Medicaid or Charity Care, you might still be entitled to financial assistance if your household income is below 300% of the [Federal Poverty Level](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines) (FPL). And if your household income is below 500% of the FPL, you get a discounted rate, which is $115% of the rate paid by Medicare, which tends to be even lower than the rate negotiated by private health insurance companies. For additional information about Charity Care, including a chart showing levels of income eligibility, see Chapter 2, Section 4.

In any case, make sure before you pay or agree to a payment plan, that you are getting any financial assistance to which you might be entitled. If you qualify for a reduced rate, that lower rate should apply to every portion of the hospital bill, including the services of every doctor who treated you there, even if they are not hospital employees. This is important to know, since physicians providing services at a hospital typically do not accept Charity Care; however, under New Jersey law, if you qualify for Charity Care and received services at a hospital on an emergency or non-emergency basis, any physician who treated you at the hospital must accept reimbursement at Charity Care levels, with you paying nothing or only a percentage.

Even if you do not qualify for Charity Care or financial assistance, do not just enter into a Payment Plan based on the full amount. You can still try to reduce the size of the bill by asking the hospital or health care provider if they will accept a lower amount. Hospitals and doctors might be open to this because they would rather not have to turn to debt collectors or lawsuits to collect from you. Start by suggesting that you pay the Medicare rate for the service or procedure. Medicare rates are available at [this website](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/physician-fee-schedule/search/overview) with its Physician Fee Schedule Look-up Tool, but they can be tricky to access because you need the five-digit Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code, also known as the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, for the particular service or procedure. Doctors use those codes to bill insurance companies and seek prior approval for health services and procedures so you can try to obtain the HCPCS/CPT codes from your provider or insurance company.

If you are unable to determine the Medicare rate because you do not have the HCPCS/CPT code or codes, then a general rule of thumb is that it is about 20% of the full charged rate. So, you should offer to pay 20% of the amount billed and make clear that it is because that is about what Medicare pays. If the provider refuses, do not give up right away but continue to try to negotiate and hopefully still arrive at an amount less than the original bill.

**The Appendix contains a template for a letter you can write to your provider or hospital in trying to negotiate a Payment Plan.**

If you are insured but have a large deductible or co-pay to satisfy, you can also try to negotiate a reduction before entering into a Payment Plan. Because the insurance company already negotiated a reduced rate, and you are not dealing with the full charged rate, however, any possible reduction would be much smaller.

Hopefully, insured or uninsured, you will get the amount reduced and the Payment Plan will be based on that lower amount. The law requires that the monthly Payment Plans are an amount that you can reasonably afford and the payments are generally supposed to be stretched out from six months to as long as five years based on your income and the amount of the debt.

## Limit on Amount of Monthly Payment

As stated above, the monthly payment cannot exceed 3% of your monthly income but only if the provider or debt collector trying to collect the debt knows that information. If it is a hospital, you might have told them your household income so they could determine if you qualified for Charity Care/financial assistance. But remember, unlike Charity Care, which is based on household income, the Payment Plan will be based on the patient’s individual monthly income. If you have not given the hospital or provider the relevant information, and you are offered a Payment Plan calling for a monthly payment higher than 3% of your monthly income, you can argue that the plan is not “reasonable” under the law, but you will then have to provide your financial information so they can calculate the amount that IS 3% of your monthly income. **Before you provide the hospital or physician with information about your income, you should make sure that they will keep the information confidential.**

Under the Louisa Carman Medical Debt Relief Act, the Payment Plan has to be in writing and state the total amount owed, the total monthly payment, the payment schedule and the interest. Even after you accept the plan and start making payments, if there is a significant change in your finances—such as loss of a job or reduced hours—the monthly payments and the length of the plan can be adjusted.

Remember, mark the due date for your first payment on your calendar to help you remember to send your payment on time. Late fees may be charged otherwise, but if you miss a payment, the provider has to give you a 60-day grace period.
