# CHAPTER THREE: WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU RECEIVE A BILL

Whether or not you are insured, at some point after you receive health care services that
are not fully covered by insurance or by Charity Care, you will receive a bill from the provider or
providers involved in your treatment. This Chapter will tell you how to read that bill, how to figure
out if it is correct – both with regard to what it is charging you for and how much—and, once
you know how much you really owe, how to work out a payment plan with the provider so that
you can pay the bill. We will also suggest how to proceed if you cannot agree with the provider
on the amount you owe, or if you disagree with a decision by your insurance company to deny
coverage or erroneously treat the bill as out-of-network.
