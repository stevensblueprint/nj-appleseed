# Section 3: Contesting the Accuracy of the Bill or Appealing Denial of Benefits by Insurer

You might not be able to agree to the Payment Plan offered by the health care facility or provider because you believe that the bill is inaccurate, which is not uncommon with medical bills. You should first contact the billing department of the hospital or provider to try to clear up the error but if that fails, you will need to take further action.

If you are insured, please discuss this issue with your insurance company by calling the phone number on the back of the card and asking for the fraud department to dispute the bill. If you did not receive the services that are being billed, if the bill is duplicative of a bill that you already paid, if the provider “up-coded” the services that you received (by billing for something more expensive) or you received an out-of-network bill when you did not deliberately decide to be treated by an out-of-network doctor (i.e., a Surprise Medical Bill), you should report these issues to your insurer. The insurer is best able to understand the situation, confirm if you are correct and will advise you how to proceed.

The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (DOBI) is responsible for implementing the No Surprises Act in New Jersey and for coordinating complaints against insurers, hospitals and physicians under the state’s own Out-of-Network law, so they are the place to complain to about a Surprise Medical Bill, under both state and federal law.

_You may file a complaint with_ **DOBI by calling the general number, 609-292-7272, or its Consumer Hotline, 800-446-7467,** _which is staffed Monday to Friday, from 8:30 am to 5 pm. Alternatively, you can mail a written complaint to DOBI’s Consumer Inquiry and Response Center, P.O. Box 471, Trenton, NJ 08625-0471, or file one [online](https://www.nj.gov/dobi/consumer.htm)._

_If you are covered under a Managed Care plan (either HMO or PPO), DOBI has an office within Consumer Protection Services that handles complaints from consumers regarding coverage and payments under the plan. If your complaint has more to do with the insurance company than the provider,_ **you can call 888-393-1062, fax 609-777-0508 or 609-292-2431, or write to:**

**Office of Managed Care**  
**Consumer Protection Services**  
**Department of Banking and Insurance**  
**PO Box 475**  
**Trenton, NJ 08625-0475**

**_Additional information about filing a complaint is available [here](https://www.nj.gov/dobi/division_insurance/managedcare/mcfaqs.htm)._**

If you are a Medicare patient, you can call 800-MEDICARE or 800-633-4227, where help is available 24/7 except for some federal holidays. TTY users can call 877-486-2048. However, if the issue involves a denial by the insurer of coverage for the services you received, or any part of them, you should file an appeal with the insurance company. This type of appeal, known as an internal appeal, must be filed within a certain time after you receive notice of the denial of benefits depending on the type of insurance you have, and each insurer has its own process. The appeal process should be set forth clearly on the insurer’s website and in its benefits manual. For further assistance on how to appeal, please refer to New Jersey Appleseed’s [A New Jersey Guide to Insurance Appeals](https://njappleseed.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/appleseed-appeals-guide.pdf).

Once your insurer makes a final decision, DOBI provides a way to appeal that denial of coverage through the [Independent Health Care Appeals Program](https://www.nj.gov/dobi/division_insurance/managedcare/ihcap.htm). It provides independent external reviews of adverse benefit determinations, including denials of requested services and/ or reimbursement of services as not medically necessary, as experimental or investigational or as cosmetic. Your right to this appeal is mandated by the New Jersey Health Care Quality Act, [N.J.S.A. 26:2S-11](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/title-26/section-26-2s-11/) and [N.J.S.A. 26:2S-12](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/title-26/section-26-2s-12/). There is a $25 fee for the appeal, which you need not pay if you win the appeal or show that you are on Medicaid NJ FamilyCare, General Assistance, Supplemental Social Security, NJ Unemployment Assistance or Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled (PAAD).

**Please note** that if you do file an appeal with your insurer, and then through the state Independent Health Care Appeals Program, neither the health care provider nor any debt collector is allowed to communicate with you about that debt or try to collect it as long as the appeal is pending or underway. This only applies, however, if they know about the appeal so you should make it a point to let them know about it, preferably before they start to try to collect but certainly once they do start and they will be required to stop until the appeal is decided.

If you are uninsured and think you’ve been sent a bill that you should not have to pay, you can file a complaint with the New Jersey Attorney General’s [Division of Consumer Affairs](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/) or consult a lawyer at one of the Legal Services offices located throughout the state, as listed in Appendix C. Either should be able to advise you on how to proceed (i.e., suggest an action plan) once they understand your individual circumstances and reasons for believing that you should not have to pay.

If you were approved for charity care, financial assistance or a discounted rate, and the bill does not reflect that approval, file a complaint with the New Jersey Hospital Care Payment Assistance Program. Call them at (866) 588-5696, email them at **Charity.Care@doh.state.nj.us**, or write to them at:

**NJ Department of Health, New Jersey Hospital Care Payment Assistance Program**  
**P.O. Box 360**  
**Trenton, NJ 08625-0360**

## Good Faith Estimate Disputes

If the bill that you seek to dispute is $400 or more than the Good Faith Estimate you previously received, proceed as follows:

- Start by contacting the doctor or hospital to notify them that they have sent you a bill that is $400 or more than the Good Faith Estimate. Then ask them to adjust the bill to the amount in the Good Faith Estimate.
- If the provider does not lower the bill, you have a right to use the federal [Patient-Provider Dispute Resolution system](https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights). Remember that you can only dispute the bill of any physician if that individual physician’s bill is $400 or more than the estimate they gave you. The right to dispute the bill based on the Good Faith Estimate is on a provider-by-provider basis and cannot be based on the total bill from all the providers that treated you added together being $400 over all the estimates you received added together.
- If you decide to formally dispute the bill using the above Dispute Resolution process, you must file within 120 days (about 4 months) of the date of your first medical bill. You must submit a copy of the bill and the Good Faith Estimate from which the bill deviated; and you must pay a $25 fee to dispute the bill. If you win the dispute, this fee will be returned to you as a $25 credit toward your medical bill.
- You may formally initiate a dispute [online](https://nsa-idr.cms.gov/billdisputes/s/) or by [mail or fax](https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/help/dispute-a-bill). Once you do so, you have entered what’s called the “Patient-Provider Dispute Resolution” period. Under the federal No Surprises Act, your doctor or hospital is prohibited from sending your medical bills to collection agencies during the Patient-Provider Dispute Resolution period. This is in addition to the newly enacted ban in New Jersey on reporting medical debt to any credit reporting agency at any time.
- If you see the medical bills from an ongoing Patient-Provider Dispute Resolution listed on your credit report, [submit a complaint online](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/) to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or by phone at 855-411-2372 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, except federal holidays. If you are a TTY user, the number is 855-729-2372.

In general, if you are either insured or uninsured and want to learn more about your rights to dispute a Surprise Medical Bill you can do so at the website of the [Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises) and/or by calling the No Surprises Help Desk at 800-985-3059. The Desk is available 7 days a week, from 8 am to 8 pm on weekdays and from 10 am to 6 pm on weekends and assistance is offered in many languages, including Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian. They can also provide resources in large print, Braille and audio.
