# Section 1: Understanding the Bill

## Difference Between a Medical Bill and the Explanation of Benefits

First, let’s clear up any confusion between a medical bill from a provider and an Explanation of Benefits from your health insurance company regarding your billed services.

Before you obtain medical care, health providers usually ask you to sign a form assigning your insurance benefits to them. That allows the doctor or other provider to bill the insurance company directly for their services. Most providers will collect your co-pay at the time of the visit and then hold off on further billing until your insurer pays its share. You will then be billed for any shortfall or difference—typically, an amount representing your co-insurance or share of the cost. There might also be some providers who want you to pay them in full at the time of service, leaving you to seek reimbursement in whole or in part from your insurance company.

Whether the insurance company pays the provider directly or reimburses you after you have paid the provider, it should send you what is call an Explanation of Benefits, which informs you about what services were billed, what was the Negotiated Rate for such services (the lower, often much lower, amount that the provider and insurer have negotiated for that particular service), what the insurer paid, what you might have paid already (usually the co-pay collected at the office at the time of service) and any additional amount still owing, which you are expected to pay.

## What to Do When You Get a Medical Bill

- Open the bill immediately.
- Be sure you understand the charges. If you do not, call the doctor’s or the facility’s billing department for an explanation of anything that is confusing. Billing departments and insurance companies can make mistakes — so if something doesn’t look right, it’s good to check.
- You should also request an _Itemized Bill_ and check it carefully before paying it. Insist on an explanation of any codes or terms you do not understand. There is no law requiring them to provide you with an itemized, plain language bill but it cannot hurt to ask.
- In examining the bill or bills, make sure that: You are being billed for services you actually received. The charges are in the correct amounts. The number of days (for a hospital stay) is correct. The procedures and medications are accurate. No charge is mistakenly duplicated. The bill reflects any amounts paid by you and your insurer.
- If you are insured, compare the bill with the _Explanation of Benefits_ your insurer sent you. If there are any discrepancies, that could indicate an error, and you should contact the provider, the insurer, or both for an explanation.
- If you are uninsured and obtained a _Good Faith Estimate_, compare the estimate with your final bill or bills. If the amount of any bill is $400 or more above the Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill. (Learn how to dispute your bill in Section 3 below.)
- If you find that you are being wrongly charged in any way, inform the provider and get them to correct the bill. You might also find that your insurance company wrongfully denied coverage or sent you a Surprise Medical Bill in violation of federal and possibly state law. Contact your insurer and ask them to fix the problem. (See Section 3 for what to do if they refuse.)
- Keep notes of your conversations with the billing department or insurance company. Include: The date and time. The name of the person you spoke with. What they told you.
- Save all bills and documents from your provider and health insurance company, and keep them together in an easy-to-find place.
- Only after you know how much you actually owe, based on correct charges and insurance payments, should you enter into a payment plan for that amount (as discussed in the next section).
