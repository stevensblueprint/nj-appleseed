# Introduction

If you live in New Jersey, this Manual is for you. It
is meant to help you and other New Jersey consumers,
whether insured or uninsured, understand what your
rights are when it comes to the cost of medical care and
the burden of medical debt—to keep you from incurring
medical debt in the first place, or help you reduce the
amount of it, and to provide advice on how to deal with
medical debt collectors and what to do if you are sued
over a medical debt.

Even if you currently have no medical debt, and
have—or think you have—good health insurance, all it
takes is for you or a member of your immediate family
to come down with a serious illness or chronic medical
condition or be injured in an accident and you might find
yourself joining the ranks of the estimated 100 million
Americans who owe more than $220 billion in medical
debt.\* In New Jersey, there are 1.5 million residents
struggling with medical debt.
We cover topics such as the availability of financial assistance, out-of-network charges
(which can lead to surprise medical bills), how to negotiate a payment plan, a new state law that
prohibits the reporting of medical debt to the credit reporting bureaus, and what you can do if a
medical debt is reported in violation of the law. We even explain the basics of how to read your
health insurance card so that you can better understand your coverage, how to properly read
a medical bill and when your insurer denies coverage or otherwise fails to pay the appropriate
benefits under your policy, how to appeal that denial. And we discuss why you might be better
off not using your credit card to pay for medical debt and why you also need to be careful about
using medical credit cards like CareCredit or other specialized medical credit cards.

_We explain it all in non-technical, easy-to-understand language._

Throughout this Manual, there are links to websites containing additional information or
forms which those who use this Manual online or in some other digital form can click on for ready
access. For those, who print out the Manual on paper and cannot make use of the hyperlinks, we
have provided the URLs (Internet addresses) in Endnotes at the end of each chapter.

The Appendix provides important forms you can
use to request an itemized bill, dispute charges with a
medical debt collector and respond to a legal case filed
against you in court for medical debt. It contains a list of
Federally Qualified Health Care Centers in New Jersey,
which provide care to everyone, regardless of ability to
pay. If you are uninsured, fees are charged on a sliding
scale based on your income. There is also information
about how to find a lawyer if you need one, and possibly
free legal services if you meet the financial criteria.

**DISCLAIMER: The information in this Manual is not legal advice. It is a source of information to help New Jerseyans deal with medical debt. For legal advice, consult an attorney.**
