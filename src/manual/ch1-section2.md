# Section 2: Understanding Your Plan—Co-pays, Co-insurance, Authorization, Appealing Denial of Benefits or Coverage

If you have health insurance, you should have an
ID card, which contains important information about
your plan. This section will help you understand
what the card says and what it means or coverage
under your plan.
The information contained on the card typically
includes:
• Your Name (or your spouse’s if you are on
their employer’s plan and will likely
also have the name of that employer)
• Name of Insurance Company
• Name and Phone Number of Primary Care Physician (PCP) if your plan requires
you to have one.
• Type of Plan – HMO, POS, PPO, self-funded, Medicare, Medicaid/NJ Family Care,
Veterans Health Benefit Plan, State Health Benefit Plan or NJ School Employees’
Health Benefit Plan
• Your Insurance Policy ID Number (if in a managed care policy)
• Your Insurance Group Number (if you are insured through an employer)
7
• Your individual Medicare or Medicaid number
• Additional numbers pertaining to pharmaceutical coverage: Rx Bin, Rx PCH, Rx Grp
• Deductible Amounts—Typically, separate amounts for in-network and out-of-network,
each of which must be met separately. The out-of-network deductible tends to be higher.
• Co-Pays for various types of services, such as Office Visit, Specialist Visit and
Emergency Room Visit
• Co-Insurance or Co-Share—Typically not included on the insurance ID card but
sometimes indicated in the name of the Plan. For example, United Healthcare’s Choice
Plus 90 plan indicates that it pays 90% of covered, in-network charges and the insured
pays the remaining 10%.
• Phone numbers (usually on the back) for members to contact the health insurer,
with separate contact number for providers.
