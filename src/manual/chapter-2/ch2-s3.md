# Section 3: Negotiating Charge and Payment in Advance

You can try to negotiate a reduction in the cost of non-emergency medical care either before or after you receive it. A New Jersey law effective in July 2025 will require health care providers to offer you a Reasonable Payment Plan after you have received care but there is no requirement that providers negotiate with you ahead of time, before they provide health services. That makes it a bit trickier to do ahead of time and some might not be willing to do so.

But you still might want to try, especially for an elective or nonemergency procedure, where you might not be willing to go ahead unless you can negotiate a lower, more affordable cost in advance. If you do try to negotiate, a good starting point is 115% of the rate paid by Medicare, which is the discounted rate that an acute care hospital must charge a patient whose income is 500% of the FPL or less. Section 4 below tells you how to find out what those rates are.

Note that under federal law, Emergency Rooms are required to provide you treatment in an emergency regardless of your insurance status or ability to pay. This right to emergency care under federal law is granted under a law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act or EMTALA. In New Jersey, however, your right to care regardless of ability to pay extends beyond emergency situations. As stated above, New Jersey law states that no hospital shall deny any admission or appropriate service to a patient on the basis of that patientâ€™s ability to pay or the source of payment, which includes necessary in-patient and out-patient medical services.
