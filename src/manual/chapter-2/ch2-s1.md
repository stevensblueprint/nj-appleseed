# Section 1: Where to Receive Care – Acute Care Hospitals and Federally Qualified Health Centers

Without insurance, it can be difficult to get a physician to see or treat you, unless you seek services at the emergency room of an acute care hospital, where they are obligated by law to provide care. Acute care hospitals provide short-term medical care for sudden illnesses or injuries and typically offer a range of services, including emergency medicine, inpatient care, surgery, diagnostic testing and intensive care. New Jersey has about 72 acute care hospitals. In contrast, other types of hospitals might focus on long-term care, rehabilitation or specialized areas of medicine such as cancer.

Still, if you do not have health insurance, there are options available to you in New Jersey, where you may be able to receive affordable or even free health care as a “self-pay” patient—one who pays out-of-pocket, usually because they do not have health insurance.

**One option is the system of Federally Qualified Health Centers or FQHCs, which are community-based nonprofit health clinics that provide primary care services to underserved communities. They are funded by the federal government and offer services regardless of ability to pay or immigration status. Services are provided on a sliding fee scale. Located throughout the state, they are listed in the Appendix, with addresses and contact information.**

A second option is to seek services at any of New Jersey’s acute care hospitals, which are required to treat patients regardless of their insurance status. [New Jersey law (N.J.S.A.26:2H-18.64)](https://njlaw.rutgers.edu/collections/njstats/showsect.php?title=26&chapter=2h&section=18.64&actn=getsect) states that no hospital shall deny any admission or appropriate service to a patient on the basis of that patient’s ability to pay or source of payment. This includes in-patient and out-patient services and covers necessary medical services. Necessary medical services are health care services that are needed to diagnose or treat an illness, injury, or disease. In practice, some hospitals are more receptive than others to serving self-pay patients. In any event, if you have a health emergency, you can go to a hospital-based emergency room and you are assured of receiving treatment, which may include outpatient treatment. Note that the same is not true for Urgent Care Centers, which are not obligated to provide care.
