# Section 4: Charity Care and Financial Assistance

When you receive health care services at a New Jersey acute care hospital (There are currently 72 of them and they are listed in the Appendix), you may qualify for the New Jersey Hospital Care Assistance Program, commonly referred to as “Charity Care.” This financial assistance program addresses how medical care received in a hospital is paid for once the patient has been treated.

The N.J. Health Care Reform Act of 1992, which contains the statutory basis for the Charity Care program, includes a powerful provision that guarantees access to hospital services regardless of ability to pay: “No hospital shall deny any admission or appropriate service to a patient on the basis of that patient’s ability to pay or source of payment.” [N.J.S.A. 26:2H-18-64](https://njlaw.rutgers.edu/collections/njstats/showsect.php?title=26&chapter=2h&section=18.64&actn=getsect). This provision applies to both for-profit and non-profit hospitals, and hospitals can incur a civil penalty of $10,000 for each violation. Who is eligible for free or reduced rate care under the program, what documentation of income must be produced when applying for such a program, and which services are covered are discussed below.

## Who is Eligible for Assistance?

Eligibility for Charity Care is based in the first instance on income level. A person is eligible for “full” Charity Care (basically free care) if their individual income (or family income, if applicable) is less than or equal to 200 percent of the [Federal Poverty Level](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines) (FPL).9 A person is eligible for “reduced charge” Charity Care if their applicable individual or family income is between 200 and 300 % of the FPL. The percentage of hospital charges paid by persons in this category is based on a sliding scale that depends on income: persons at 200 to 225% of the FPL pay 20% of the charges, while those between 225 to 250% pay 40%, those between 250 to 275% pay 60% and those between 275 and 300 percent of FPL pay 80 percent of charges, and persons with incomes greater than 300% of the FPL receive no assistance.

There is also help for those whose incomes are higher than 300% of the FPL but below 500%. Hospitals are prohibited from charging an uninsured person whose family income is less than 500% of the FPL more than 115% of the Medicare reimbursement rate. [N.J.S.A. 26:2H-12:52](https://njlaw.rutgers.edu/collections/njstats/showsect.php?title=26&chapter=2h&section=12.52&actn=getsect).

### 2025 INCOME ELIGIBILITY FOR CHARITY CARE/FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

FPL & Medicare Rate Reference Links

The 2025 Federal Poverty Level is available at [this website](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines).

To find out what the Medicare rate is for a particular health service, here is a link to [the website](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/physician-fee-schedule/search/overview) that contains that Search tool. Note that you will have to click through two screens and once you arrive at the actual Search page, you will need the five-digit CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) Code, also known as HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System), for the particular procedure you want to look up. If you have already received the care in question, the CPT/HCPCS code might appear on the bill. If not, ask the provider or hospital who provided the service, or will provide it. If you are insured, the codes might appear on the Explanation of Benefits the insurance company sends you or you can call the insurer and ask.

Be aware that what appears to be a single procedure might have more than one code that applies to it and you will have to search the Medicare reimbursement rate for each of those codes and add the amounts together.

## Calculating Income

Although there is no discretion with respect to the amount of income to qualify for the various Charity Care levels, an applicant has some flexibility in trying to qualify by choosing one of three different time periods in which to measure income. Gross annual income can be measured for the full 12 months preceding the date of service, or by income for the prior three months (multiplied by four), or by income in the prior month (multiplied by 12). You may choose whichever of these time periods results in the lowest income so that you can qualify for financial assistance. [N.J.A.C. 10:52-11.8(e)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-10-52-11-8). This option is important to low-income, uninsured individuals who do not have steady income throughout the year. You need to be aware of this regulation since many hospital administrators are not.

## Documenting Income

Charity Care applicants also have the option of proving their income by a variety of methods. applicable regulations very sensibly recognize both that there may be a variety of methods to ument income during the relevant period and that some applicants may not be able to prove ome by conventional means, such as a pay-check stub, W-2 form, letter from an employer, ual Social Security statement, etc. The regulations specifically permit an applicant who is e to document his income by conventional means to provide a written attestation (a declaration er penalty of perjury) of income. [N.J.A.C. 10:52-11.9(a)(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-10-52-11-9). This is another important option vided in the Charity Care regulations that hospital administrators may not tell you about.

## Asset Eligibility Test

In addition to proving income eligibility, individuals must pass an asset eligibility test. The asset limits are $7,500 for an individual and $15,000 for a family, if applicable. The regulations specify what types of assets are included, basically cash and things that can be easily converted to cash, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, corporate stock, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and equity in real estate, except that a primary residence is a specifically excluded asset so if you own your home, you can still qualify. [N.J.A.C. 10:52-11.1 (c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-10-52-11-10). You must be careful to make sure that a hospital does not take into account assets that you might hold but which either cannot be readily converted into cash or are not actually owned by you but held in trust for a parent or child.

Another important limitation on the asset limits is that an applicant must have an opportunity to try to get below the $15,000 limit by deducting any amounts they have already paid or will pay for medical services, known as “qualified medical expenses,” which are the same kinds of medical expenses you can deduct on your federal income tax return. Most medical expenses—such as doctor visits and prescription drugs—would be included but not most cosmetic procedures and nonprescription drugs. There is a long list on [this website](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p502#:~:text=see%20Pub.%20555.-,How%20Much%20of%20the%20Expenses%20Can%20You%20Deduct%3F,than%207.5%25%20of%20your%20AGI), which includes abortion and acupuncture, ambulances, supplies such as bandages and wheelchairs, birth control pills, condoms, pregnancy test kits and vasectomies, Braille reading materials (if you are visually impaired), hearing aids, programs to help you stop smoking (though not nicotine patches or gum or other drugs to help you quit) or lose weight (if it is a treatment for a specific disease diagnosed by a doctor such as obesity or heart disease) and many more health-related expenses.

Here is an example of how meeting the Charity Care asset limit works: A married individual has family income below 200 percent of the FPL, but also $16,000 in a bank account. Assume that the hospital bill is $50,000. Despite appearing to be disqualified because their assets are $1,000 above the limit, they might still qualify if they or their spouse has already incurred uncovered prescription drug or dental expenses during the year that exceed $1,000 or if they agree to pay $1,000 of the $50,000 medical bill.

## What Services are Covered?

It is undisputed that “necessary” inpatient and outpatient hospital services are covered by the Charity Care program. The statute that authorizes this is [N.J.S.A. 26:2h-18.60(b)](https://njlaw.rutgers.edu/collections/njstats/showsect.php?title=26&chapter=2h&section=18.60&actn=getsect), which says that a person whose income is less than or equal to 300% of the FPL shall be eligible for charity care for “necessary health care services provided at a hospital.” These include services as varied as advanced life support (ALS) services and outpatient dialysis services. [N.J.A.C. 8:31B-4.38](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-8-31B-4-38). ALS services include pre-hospital services provided by a mobile intensive care unit in an ambulance, which are required to be covered by regulations that are separate from the main Charity Care regulations.

The most controversial and uncertain issue is whether hospital-based services that are provided by doctors but are separately billed by them are covered by Charity Care. For example, a patient who goes to the Emergency Room with chest pain and is hospitalized for a cardiac catheterization may be determined eligible for Charity Care but may nevertheless receive separate bills from the Emergency Room doctor, the radiologist, the anesthesiologist, and even the cardiologist who performs the catheterization. Many people assume that since the bill is not directly from the hospital, the service is not covered by Charity Care, and many physicians who provide such emergency care services in the hospital deny that they are able to bill patients separately. On the other hand, there is a strong argument that allowing the patient to be billed for these medical services that occurred in the hospital would defeat the language and purpose of the Charity Care statute. The statute requires Charity Care to cover income-eligible patients who receive treatment at an acute care facility—treatment that is provided by a physician. Accordingly, not just hospital-employed physicians must provide services on the terms required by Charity Care, but all physicians providing such services at these locations.

If you or a family member receives a bill from an individual physician who provided services to you at an acute care hospital, please contact Legal Services of New Jersey (call their Help Line, which is available Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., at 888-LSNJ-LAW or 888-576-5529). Or you can seek representation to help challenge the bill from one of the Legal Services offices located throughout the state, as listed in Appendix C.

## What Are a Hospital’s Charity Care Notification Responsibilities?

Individuals obviously cannot apply for Charity Care if they are unaware of the program. Therefore, hospitals have a legal responsibility to make sure that you and other patients are aware of the program, are given an opportunity to apply, and are given an explanation of the reasons if the application is denied. The most fundamental hospital responsibility is to give each patient a written notice of the availability of Charity Care no later than the date that the first bill is sent. However, we recommend that if you are uninsured and believe that you are incomeeligible, you should not wait for the bill but should ask for a Charity Care application prior to being discharged from the hospital or immediately after.

In addition, as mentioned above, you may be eligible for another medical assistance program (such as Medicaid or New Jersey FamilyCare), and the hospital must refer you to the appropriate program within three months of the date of service. These responsibilities of the hospital are enforceable; meaning that **if the hospital does not provide written notice of Charity Care availability or make an appropriate referral for another medical assistance program within the applicable time limits, the hospital may not bill you for the service.** [N.J.A.C. 10:52-11.5(d)(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-10-52-11-5). This is important for you to raise with the hospital or any person trying to collect the bill on behalf of the hospital, and you should demand a Charity Care application if you have not previously done so

You have the right to submit a Charity Care application to the hospital at any time within a year from the date of the service, and the hospital may extend that period to within two years of the date of service. Indeed, a hospital has an incentive to extend that period to two years, since if you do qualify for Charity Care, the hospital will be reimbursed by the State for that service, while if the hospital does not take the application, it will have to go through the effort of trying to collect from you, even though you might have no ability to pay, even if a judgment is entered against you. The hospital must inform you, the applicant, in writing within 10 days of its decision on your Charity Care application. It must also inform you if you provided insufficient information with the application or of other reasons for denying it.

A non-profit group called [Dollar For](https://dollarfor.org/) might be able to help you with the application process. Their website has a simple, no-cost tool that they say will provide you with a quick answer on whether you are eligible for Charity Care. You input the amount and date of the hospital bill, your household income and size, and whether or not you are insured. If the tool says you qualify, they invite you to fill out their online form and offer to prepare your application and send it to the hospital within one to three weeks. Once your application is submitted, they say they will email and text you to check in and give you tips on how to follow up and, if necessary, help you submit additional documents and prepare an appeal.

## Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund

Another possible source of assistance is the [Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund](https://www.nj.gov/humanservices/cicrf/) (CICRF). It is a state program available to help pay expenses for New Jersey families whose children have an illness or condition where at least part of those expenses are not covered by insurance, State or Federal programs, or other sources, such as fundraising. The Fund is intended to assist in preserving a family’s ability to cope with the responsibilities which accompany a child’s significant health problems.

The assistance is available for any type of illness so long as the costs of dealing with it are “catastrophic” for the family. There is no income requirement but the total amount of eligible medical expenses incurred in any 12-month time period must meet or exceed 10% of the first $100,000 of the family’s income, plus 15% of any additional income over $100,000. You can apply for multiple 12-month periods and as far back as seven years.

A broad range of medical expenses is covered, including but not limited to: physician care in all settings, therapies, pharmaceuticals, acute or specialized hospital care, medical equipment or disposable medical supplies, medically related home and vehicle modifications and medical transport; home health care; and addiction and mental health services.

You cannot apply for payment of medical expenses in advance but must wait until the medical treatment and services have been provided and then seek reimbursement. In fact, you must submit the Explanation of Benefits in applying for the Fund so it is best to wait until the claims have been processed through insurance. You can apply for claims that have not been paid in full because the Fund will not only reimburse you for expenses paid out of pocket but can pay providers directly for outstanding balances.

Children up to age 21 are covered but reimbursement can be sought for a child older than that if the expenses were incurred while they were still under 22. Undocumented children are not eligible. The assistance is available only for children who are legally domiciled in New Jersey AND are U.S. citizens or green card holders, or who have obtained legal immigration status (i.e., hold visas that allow a family to establish residency).
