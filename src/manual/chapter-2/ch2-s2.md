# Section 2: Getting a Fair Estimate of Costs

If you are uninsured or “self-pay” (or are not planning to submit your medical bills to a health insurance company), it can be helpful to know in advance what you will be charged for your medical care. The federal No Surprises Act gives an uninsured patient some important tools to find out what their medical costs will be, before they get treatment.

**The law requires health care providers to give patients who ask for it a so-called “Good Faith Estimate” of what the services are expected to cost. You should always ask for an estimate and then keep it in a safe place.** This is important because if you decide to undergo treatment with the physician or facility that gives you a Good Faith Estimate, you have certain rights to dispute the actual bill if it is at least $400 higher than the estimate you were given. This is discussed further in Chapter 3.

Health care providers, not just hospitals, must use a form similar to this one to inform you of the expected costs for treatment in writing. The form must include the provider’s name and list the services included in the estimate—including the billing codes for each treatment, medication, laboratory test, or other medical service. It must list a total amount along with an itemized breakdown of what you will owe for each expected service and/or medical treatment. Make sure the estimate contains your name and address in addition to your provider’s name and address, billing codes, and a plain-language explanation of the treatment and the estimated price you are expected to pay.

Although you may also request that your physician include in their estimate all ancillary services associated with the treatment, they are not required to do so. Rather, you will likely need to ask for a separate Good Faith Estimate from each doctor and each health care facility to better understand the entire expense of your expected care.

Remember that a **Good Faith Estimate is not a contract and does not obligate you to use those doctors and/or hospitals**. It is also important to note that you can ask your doctors and hospitals for a Good Faith Estimate at any time—even if you are not ready to schedule your treatment. On the other hand, the physician must provide you with the Good Faith Estimate, in writing, within one business day after your request, if the care scheduled is within the next three to nine days; and within three business days, if the care is scheduled for within the next 10 days. If the Good Faith Estimate is provided electronically, it must be supplied in a form that can be printed and saved. If you delay your care for more than a month, check back in with that provider to make sure the Good Faith Estimate is still accurate.

Note that the Hospital Transparency Rule, [45 C.F.R. Part 180](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-E/part-180), which took effect in 2021, [requires hospitals to post their prices online](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/hospital-price-transparency-frequently-asked-questions.pdf) so before you even request a Good Faith Estimate from one or more hospitals, it should be possible to “shop around” to finds a hospital that charges less for the procedure in question. The [NJ Hospital Price Compare](http://www.njhospitalpricecompare.com/Default) website might be able to help you with the price checking process. But never rely on it alone and always request a Good Faith Estimate.

## Find Out if You Qualify for Assistance or Insurance

Knowing whether you are eligible for financial assistance or insurance is crucial in getting an idea of what anticipated medical care will cost you. If you decide to have treatment at an acute care hospital, at any time prior to your appointment you may also ask to be screened for New Jersey’s financial assistance program (i.e., Charity Care, discussed more fully in Chapter 1 and in Section 4 of this Chapter) or public health insurance coverage, such as Medicaid: Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid or Aged, Blind & Disabled (ABD) Medicaid; Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP), which covers children 18 years or younger in households with income 355% of the Federal Poverty level (FPL) or less, regardless of immigration status; or any program focused on a subsection of the population, such as pregnant women.
