## Section 4: Your Rights After a Judgment Against You

If you end up with a Judgment against you, you either went to trial and lost or you lost without trial on a Motion for Summary Judgment. In either case, you can file an “Appeal” if you think the court got it wrong. The other possibility is that the court issued a “Default Judgment” against you because you did not file an Answer or you did, but maybe you did not show up for trial, or missed some other deadline and the Plaintiff won by “default,” equivalent to a forfeit in sports.

If you knew you were being sued and failed to defend the lawsuit – for whatever reason—maybe the claim was legitimate and you felt you had no defense, or the claim was not legitimate but you felt you would lose anyway because the other side had a lawyer and you didn’t or some other reason, there is really nothing you can do to set aside the Judgment. This is the very reason not to ignore the lawsuit. Responding to a Medical Debt claim either in Small Claims Court or Special Civil Part provides an opportunity to settle the matter for an amount that is less than what is requested in the Complaint because the amount of a Judgment against you will include added fees and interest.

## Motion for Relief –Setting Aside a Default Judgment

If the reason you did not defend the claim in court, either in Special Civil Part or in Small Claims, is that you did not know about it, you might be able to have the Judgment thrown out, especially if the Plaintiff/Creditor who sued you did not properly serve you the papers, maybe sent them to an old address or otherwise failed to ensure that you received them. If this is what happened, you can file a “Motion for Relief from Judgment” under [Court Rule 4:50](https://www.njcourts.gov/attorneys/rules-of-court), on the basis that the Default Judgment is void for lack of proper service or notice of the lawsuit. If the Motion for Relief is granted, it will not get rid of the case, but essentially gives you a do-over and a chance to defend the case on the merits.

You are required to file the Motion for Relief within a “reasonable time,” so act quickly once you become aware of the Default Judgment. Along with the Motion, you will have to file an Answer to the Complaint if the case is in Special Civil Part (and pay the $30 filing fee for an Answer). There is an additional fee of $25 for filing the Motion unless you qualify for the Fee Waiver discussed in Section 3 of this Chapter.

If you have questions about how to file a Motion for Relief, you can call the Ombudsman in your county, whose contact information can be found on the [court website.](https://www.njcourts.gov/public/directories/court-services/ombudsman)

[Additional information about how to file a Motion in Special Civil Part](http://njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/10543_motion_spccvl.pdf) can also be found on the court website.

## Appealing the Judgment

If you do not have a basis to file a Motion for Relief but you did not owe the money or the Judgment was otherwise incorrect, or if the court denies your Motion for Relief, you can [file an Appeal with the Appellate Division](https://www.njcourts.gov/faq/can-i-appeal-a-special-civil-court) asking them to overturn or reverse the Judgment against you. You can appeal whether the matter was heard in Small Claims Court or Special Civil Part. You will have to request and pay for a transcript of what happened in the trial court. You have 45 days to file the Appeal and at the same time, must also file a Case Information Statement and a copy of the Request for Transcript. Copies of all of those papers must be delivered by mail to the lawyer for the Plaintiff/Creditor whose judgment you are appealing, or upon the Plaintiff/Creditor directly, in the unlikely event they do not have a lawyer. Copies of these documents must also be delivered by mail to the judge who decided the case.

You file the Request for a Transcript with the Office of the Special Civil Part in the county where the case was tried and at that time, you must deposit with the Court Clerk the estimated cost of the Transcript which will likely be $300 unless the trial took longer than one day in which case it is $300 per day. Once you receive the Transcript, you will have to file three copies of it with the Appellate Division.

There is also a $250 fee for filing the Appeal, unless you obtain a Fee Waiver as discussed in Section 3 of this Chapter. Within 30 days of filing the Appeal you must deposit an additional $300 with the Appellate Division Clerk to cover court costs and settlement, though if you win the appeal, that money is returned to you.

Given the various costs for an Appeal, totaling at least $800, before deciding to file one, you should give serious consideration to whether it is cost-effective, based on the amount at stake in your case.

## Enforcement of a Judgment Against Your Property

A Plaintiff with a Judgment against you is known as a “Judgment Creditor” and can seek to collect that Judgment in several ways. They can get an order requiring your job to pay them a portion of your wages, which is known as wage garnishment, seize money from your bank account or seize other valuable personal property. They can also put a lien on property such as your house, which can make it more difficult to sell or borrow against.

After the Judgment is obtained, the Judgment Creditor will try to find out what assets you have. They will probably serve you with an “[Information Subpoena](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/11840_infor_sub_written_quest.pdf)" that asks about your checking and savings accounts, other personal (non-land) assets you own and where you work. You are legally required to provide this information and must do so within 14 days of the day the Subpoena was served on you or face court penalties. If you do not answer within that time, the Judgment Creditor can obtain a court order allowing them to subpoena the information directly from the bank or your employer or others

Based on the information obtained, the Judgment Creditor can then get the court to issue a “[Writ of Execution](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/11711_complete_writ_execution.pdf)” for your bank account, your wages or other property such as a car, or other valuable items such as jewelry, boats, TVs, etc. The Writ of Execution can then be served by the Sheriff on your employer, your bank, or anyone else who might owe you money. Writs of Execution generally expire after two years, after which the Judgment Creditor can request a new one using the same procedures.

Note that certain types of income cannot be touched by a creditor: Social Security benefits; General Assistance welfare benefits or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; veterans’ benefits and unemployment compensation.

## Wage Garnishment

Wage Garnishment can be used to require your employer to pay a portion of your wages to satisfy the Medical Debt Judgment. They cannot take all of your paycheck. There is a sliding scale of how much they can garnish: As a general rule, if your total earnings are below $217.50 per week and your net take-home pay is $154.50 or less, you are exempt from wage garnishment. If your income is above those amounts but at or below 250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for your family size, up to 10% of your income can be garnished. If it is above 250% of the FPL, as much as 25% of your wages can be garnished.

However, the [Louise Carman Medical Debt Relief Act](https://pub.njleg.state.nj.us/Bills/2024/PL24/48_.PDF), passed in July 2024, added additional tection against Wage Garnishment that applies only to Medical Debt. Starting in July 2025, r wages cannot be garnished for Medical Debt at all if you make less than six times (600% the FPL. Based on 2025 FPL amounts, that means your wages cannot be garnished after that e if you make less than $93,900.

[Here is a link to the 2025 FPL](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines). Note that the FPL is updated every year in late January based on the Consumer Price Index so these dollar amounts will need to be updated in January 2026 and every January after that. Be sure to check for the most recent FPL.

## The Process of Wage Garnishment

After the Judgment Creditor wins a Judgment against you and obtains information about your assets through an Information Subpoena, they can ask the court for a Writ of Execution against your wages. You will receive a document called a “[Notice of Application for Wage Execution](http://njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/11236_notice_app_wage_exec.pdf)” and have a chance to object to it. The grounds for objection might be one of several reasons, including that there is no judgment against you on which to base the garnishment, your income is less than 600% of the FPL, or that your wages are already being garnished by someone else based on a different judgment. It is a general court rule in New Jersey that only one creditor is allowed to garnish your wages at one time so if another creditor is already doing that, no one else can do so and if they try, you should complain to the court about it. NOTE: _There is an exception to the one-garnishment-at-a-time rule which allows another garnishment at the same time for the purpose of collecting child support._ Regardless of the ground for your objection, the document you must file is “[Objection to Wage Garnishment.](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12322_obj_wage_garnish.pdf)” As with the Answer and every other paper you file with the court, you must serve it on the other party – the Judgment Creditor – and also file with it a “Certification of Service” (a signed document confirming you actually served the document on the other side in a lawsuit), in accordance with Court Rule 1:5-3.

The court will then hold a hearing. If you do not appear (show up) for the hearing or the court does not agree with your Objection, it will issue a “Writ of Execution” which the Sheriff delivers to your employer. Writs of Execution against wages can last for 20 years or until the debt is fully paid. If you are in the military, you might be able to stop the garnishment, especially if you show the court that you did not take part in the case due to military assignment or essential military duty.

If the debt collector improperly tries to garnish wages for medical debt that are supposed to be protected (e.g., all your wages if you make below 600% of the FPL), you should file an “Objection” with the court that they are violating the law. The [court website](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/12322_obj_wage_garnish.pdf) tells you how to object and contains a worksheet that helps you calculate if they are taking too much. You can also [file a complaint](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/Pages/Consumer-Complaints.aspx) with the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Office of the Attorney General.

## Bank Levy/Garnishing A Bank Account

Another way that a Judgment Creditor might try to collect on a Judgment is by way of a bank levy. Again, the Creditor obtains the Writ of Execution from the court and has the Sheriff serve the writ on the bank you identified in answering the Information Subpoena. The Sheriff notifies the bank, which freezes the account, meaning you will not be able to access those funds to pay bills or withdraw any cash. The Judgment Creditor then files a motion in court asking that the funds be turned over to pay the Judgment. As with wages, you will have a chance to object, in which case there will be a hearing and if you do not object or the judge does not agree with your objection, the court will sign the order allowing the creditor to be paid with money from the account. Depending on the size of the debt and the amount held in the account, it is possible for all the money to go to the creditor, leaving nothing. Most states have laws that protect some of the money in a bank account so that it cannot all be taken, but _New Jersey is not one of them._

A Writ of Execution on a bank account expires in two years and if any money is still owed, the Writ can be renewed.

A [court website](https://www.njcourts.gov/self-help/collecting-money-civil) with information about collecting a judgment by going after a bank account or other personal property, is meant for creditors but contains information helpful to debtors.

## Additional Ways a Judgment Can Be Collected--Personal Property

Other property that the Judgment Creditor can try to seize to collect the debt includes your car (if registered in your name and if you have equity in it), jewelry, clothing, household items (perhaps valuable art or electronics) and office or sports equipment, including boats. Note that the law allows you to keep up to $1,000 in clothing and personal property and if your personal possessions are worth less than $1,000, they cannot go after any of it. Any items seized can be sold at public auction to satisfy the Judgment.

## Additional Ways a Judgment Can Be Collected--Homes and Other Real Estate

The Judgment Creditor can also ask the court for permission to sell your real estate. But if the ratio of the value of your home to your debt is very high, it is unlikely that permission will be granted. Instead, it is more likely that the Judgment Creditor will register the judgment as a lien on your home, which can create problems if you try to sell it or borrow against it.

## Bankruptcy Option

If your medical bills are extensive and you owe thousands of dollars, a last option might be to file for personal bankruptcy. In order to properly explore the bankruptcy option, you should confer with an attorney. The information that follows is intended to help you understand the process, and some basic aspects of the law. It is not intended to give you legal advice.

Here is what happens as soon as you file a bankruptcy petition. An automatic stay kicks in, which protects you from most creditors, including those who have not obtained a Judgment against you. They cannot contact you about the debt, sue you over it or try to collect any judgment, so they cannot seize your assets or garnish your wages or foreclose on your home. The stay does not apply, however, to child support or alimony and the IRS is allowed to withhold tax refunds that might be due to you. Creditors can also ask the court to lift or end the stay.

**There are two types of bankruptcy available to individuals and couples: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13.**

[With Chapter 7](https://www.njb.uscourts.gov/content/chapter-7-debtor-assistance-resource-guide), your non-exempt assets are sold and used to pay your unsecured debts (those not backed by a mortgage or lien), including credit card debt and medical debt.

Bankruptcy law exempts the following types and amounts of your equity in various types of property as follows:

![alt text](/assets/manual/bankruptcy.png)

If you are filing a joint petition for bankruptcy as a married couple, these exemptions are doubled. Also exempt, with no maximum value, are professionally prescribed health aids used by the debtor or a dependent such as a wheelchair or sleep apnea machine.

Debts that cannot be paid are discharged, or wiped clean, with certain exceptions, including taxes, student loans, fines, alimony, child support and debts arising from fraud or malicious acts.

Before filing for either type of bankruptcy, you are legally required to obtain credit counseling from an approved, certified credit counselor. It usually costs about $50 but the fee night be waived or reduced based on your financial circumstances. The counseling generally lasts from 60 to 90 minutes and can be done in person, online or by phone. It is meant to help you understand whether bankruptcy is the best option and how to better manage your finances. Debtor education is also required before discharge, which is what it is called when the case officially ends. There is a [federal bankruptcy court website](https://www.justice.gov/ust/list-credit-counseling-agencies-approved-pursuant-11-usc-111) where you can search for approved credit counseling agencies.

**Chapter 7** is intended to allow for a fresh start, but because the federal exemption protects such a small amount of equity, you can lose your house. You cannot protect your home from debt collectors by choosing not to file for bankruptcy, because New Jersey state law contains no homestead exemption to protect you from creditors who might seek to go after your home equity.

The federal bankruptcy exemptions for personal property are also larger than the $1,000 that is protected under state law if you do not file for bankruptcy. But you can still lose your car and other property such as vacation homes, investment accounts and luxury items. Chapter 7 also does great damage to your credit score and can make it difficult to borrow for a long time after.

If your income is below the median in your state, you are presumed to qualify for Chapter 7. If it is above the median, there is a presumption that Chapter 7 is not appropriate because it is only for those who really are not able to pay their debts. You can still qualify, however, if you pass a “[means test](https://www.justice.gov/ust/means-testing),” which compares your average income over the last six months, annualized (multiplied by 12), to the median income for the same size household in New Jersey. The means test helps someone qualify for Chapter 7 who might not otherwise do so based on annual income, but whose income has decreased recently.

[Chapter 13](https://www.njb.uscourts.gov/content/chapter-13-debtor-assistance-resource-guide), on the other hand, allows you to keep more of your assets, even if you are behind on paying off your mortgage and or credit card. Under this option, you must commit to a court-approved repayment plan to pay off your debts over a period of three to five years, depending on your income. You make monthly payments to a bankruptcy trustee, who then pays your creditors. During that time, you are protected against wage garnishment. Only people who are employed and have a steady flow of income above the median family income qualify for Chapter 13. The Court or an attorney will let you know if you are eligible.

With Chapter 13, the automatic stay usually lasts until the three to five years of your plan have passed. But if you filed for bankruptcy already within the past year, the automatic stay might only last 30 days.

## Filing Fees

The [filing fees for bankruptcy](https://www.njb.uscourts.gov/court-info/court-fees) are $338 for Chapter 7 and $313 for Chapter 13.

As noted above, it is highly recommended that before you file for bankruptcy, you hire a lawyer to help you. The Appendix contains information on how to find legal assistance, including possible free legal assistance if you qualify.

Your post-judgment options for debt relief are very limited. That is why you should try to resolve your medical debts before you are taken to court. If that is not possible you should try resolution through the settlement process that is available to you only if you appear in Small Claims Court or after you have filed an Answer to the Complaint filed against you in Special Civil Part and overcome a Motion for Summary Judgment (that is often made by the Plaintiff if there are no facts in dispute)
