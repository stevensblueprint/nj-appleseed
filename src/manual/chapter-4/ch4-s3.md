# Section 3: How to Deal with a Debt Collection Lawsuit

At some point, you might receive, either in person or by mail, notification that you have been sued over a medical debt. What we said about the debt collection process is even more true when it comes to a lawsuit: **DO NOT IGNORE IT.** It will not go away on its own.

**Please contact an attorney to discuss your options.** Information on where you can locate one to represent you is included in the Appendix. Whether it makes sense for you to defend the lawsuit or accept a default judgment depends on various factors: whether you have income or assets that the creditor will likely attempt to seize if they win a court judgment against you; whether you have a viable defense to the lawsuit; whether there are facts in dispute; or whether it is best for you to file for bankruptcy, among other possibilities. Only an attorney with whom you discuss your individual circumstances will be able to properly advise you on how to proceed. In this Manual, we can only explain what can happen if you do not respond and assist you in understanding the procedure if you do choose to respond on a pro se basis—meaning without a lawyer. If you cannot find or afford a lawyer, you should refer to the [court website](https://www.njcourts.gov/public/get-help), which has information meant to assist those without legal representation.

As mentioned earlier regarding the debt collection phase, having a lawyer and fighting back by disputing the debt or, once a lawsuit is filed, defending against it, might make the creditor think it is just too much trouble to keep going after you— to the point that they do not sue you in the first place or drop the lawsuit. This is especially likely when the lawsuit is not filed by the original creditor— the health care provider—but by a third-party debt buyer who probably paid pennies on the dollar to buy a huge number of debts, many of which are backed by documentation that is sloppy or incomplete and who likely expects to write off a good number of those debts as noncollectable.

## Default Judgments

Debt buyers even more than original creditors count on the fact that many of those they sue will ignore the case, leading the court to issue a Default Judgment against them without the debt buyer or debt collector having to prove that the debt is valid and that the amount sought is correct. If you do not respond and defend yourself and end up with a Default Judgment against you, it will likely be for a greater amount than just the medical debt since it can include court costs, legal fees and interest. These increased costs can happen even if you did not really owe the debt at all, the amount was wrong, or the debt was so old that they no longer had a legal right to sue on it

Read below for more on defending yourself against a lawsuit.

## Debt Collection Courts

Debt collection suits are typically brought in state court, at one of three court levels depending on the amount claimed to be owed:

- Small Claims Court, for amounts up to $5,000
- Special Civil Part, for higher amounts up to $20,000 and
- Superior Court, Civil Part, Law Division, for amounts over $20,000.

Lawsuits over most debts, including medical debts, take place in Special Civil Part, although a few might be filed in the other courts. This Manual will focus on Special Civil Part and provide limited information on how to respond to a Complaint filed in Small Claims Court. _If you receive a Complaint that was filed in the Law Division, which means the debt is for over $20,000 please consult with an attorney._ Information on where you can locate one to represent you is included in the Appendix.

## Reading a Debt Collection Complaint

There are minor differences between the Special Civil Part and Small Claims Complaints but they mostly look the same and contain similar information. Both will be labeled “Complaint” and indicate which court you are being sued in and in which county the court is located. That is likely to be the county where the one suing you is located, which might not be the county where you live.

Whichever court the lawsuit was filed in, it is essential to read the Complaint and any other papers received about the case, carefully and thoroughly. The Complaint will state the name and address of the “Plaintiff,” along with their email address and phone number and should explain why they are suing you and for how much, which is known as the “Demand.” You, the one being sued, are called the “Defendant,” and the Complaint should contain your contact information too. The Small Claims Court Complaint has four check boxes for the main kinds of claims and the one checked should be “Contract” because failure to pay a medical debt is considered a breach of the agreement you made in promising to pay for the medical services whether or not you signed such a statement at the hospital or doctor’s office at the time you received those services.

You will also receive a document called a “Summons,” which contains some of the same information, but also the contact information for the court and for the Plaintiff’s lawyer. The Summons also tells you about additional money the Plaintiff wants from you, above and beyond the amount of the debt, and which they will be entitled to if they win the lawsuit—the fees for filing and serving the case on you, interest, and the fees paid to their lawyer for suing you.

Both the Complaint and the Summons contain a “Docket Number,” which you should use in any communication with the court and with the Plaintiff or their attorney about the case, and you should also write it on any checks you send to the court for filing or other fees.

_You must file an “Answer” to the Special Civil Complaint with the court within 35 days of the date the papers were sent to you._ That date should appear on the Summons. The Appendix contains a form you can use for the Answer.

_You do not need to file an Answer if the case is in Small Claims Court,_ only show up on the specified date.

Court personnel can provide only limited assistance with your case if you do not have a lawyer. Probably the best place to start is to call the court Ombudsman for your county. A [directory of them](https://www.njcourts.gov/public/directories/court-services/ombudsman) with their contact information is available on the court website.

## Filing Fee and Fee Waiver

_In Special Civil Part, you must pay a $30 fee to file your Answer unless you obtain a Fee Waiver, which is available if you cannot afford the fee._ To obtain a Fee Waiver, you will have to file a separate document requesting one at the same time as you file your Answer to the Medical Debt Complaint filed against you. The Fee Waiver application will ask for certain information about your income and assets so the court can decide if you qualify for the Waiver. Documentation is required—two months for sources of income and six months of bank statements. [Additional information about Fee Waivers](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/11208_filingfeewaiver.pdf), including the form that must be used, can be found on the court website.

Note that the fee for filing an Answer, like other fees mentioned in this Manual, is subject to change and you should check the court website to confirm the current fee amount.

## Answering the Complaint

To answer the lawsuit or Complaint in Special Civil part, you can utilize the Answer form and Certification of Service (a signed document confirming you actually served the document on the other side in a lawsuit) that are included in the Appendix or the similar but [more general form of Answer that can be found on the court website, along with instructions on how to answer the Complaint.](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/10542_ans_cplt_spc.pdf?cb=b0145db2)

Whichever form of Answer you use, carefully fill out the form, making sure that the information you provide is complete and accurate. Page One of the Complaint will include a Docket Number which you should include on the Answer and on any other document that you file with the Court and on any communication about the case with the Court and the Plaintiff. The Answer form in the Appendix, like the one provided by the court on its website, asks whether or not you want a jury trial. If you do, you must pay an additional $100 fee on top of the $30 fee for filing the Answer itself, unless you apply for and obtain a Fee Waiver, as discussed above. A jury trial is not available in Small Claims Court.

The Answer form in the Appendix, like the one provided by the court on its website, asks whether or not you want a jury trial. If you do, you must pay an additional $100 fee on top of the $30 fee for filing the Answer itself, unless you apply for and obtain a Fee Waiver, as discussed above. A jury trial is not available in Small Claims Court.

The Answer has a Certification section (not to be confused with the Certification of Service, which is a separate document with a different purpose), which requires that you indicate certain things about the lawsuit: whether there is another lawsuit or arbitration about the same debt or if one is planned and if so, to identify it; and also, whether or not anyone else should be a part of the lawsuit and if so, who they are. In a Medical Debt case, this might mean your health insurance company might need to be part of the case if you are being sued for a bill that you think your insurer should have paid, or paid a larger share of. If so, you should indicate that in the appropriate place.

At the very bottom of the Answer, you can check a box to require that the Plaintiff/Creditor provide you with a copy of all the documents that they refer to in the Complaint within five days. We recommend that you check that box just in case you do not have everything so that you can fully understand and better defend against the lawsuit

Two other items that you must certify to in the Answer are that: 1) you removed all or at least all but the last four numbers of any confidential personal identifying information--Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, vehicle plate numbers, insurance policy numbers, active financial account numbers, active credit card numbers or information as to an individual’s military status; and 2) you served the Answer on all parties to the case. Serving the Answer means that you sent the Plaintiff a copy of your Answer by certified AND regular mail. However, if the Plaintiff has a lawyer, you only need to send your Answer to the lawyer by regular mail. The Certification of Service referred to above states that you did one or the other.

**Filing the Answer with the Court can be done in person, by mail, or electronically using the court’s [JEDS (Judiciary Electronic Document Submission) system](https://www.njcourts.gov/self-help/jeds), though you must first create an account if you want to submit your papers electronically.**

**Do not miss the deadline to file the Answer!** If you need more time to file or to find a lawyer to represent you, you can ask the Plaintiff’s lawyer for an extension and if they agree to give you more time, you should confirm the agreement of the new date in writing. If they refuse and you have a reason for the delay, you can ask the court for extra time.

In your Answer, you should assert any of the following defenses that accurately reflect your situation by checking the relevant box on the Answer form. The boxes that may be relevant to Medical Debt include:

- the bill was paid;
- the amount is incorrect;
- the claim or amount is unfair (you must explain);
- the goods or services were not received;
- you were a victim of identity theft (someone obtained medical services pretending to be you);
- the debt was already sued on and the case was resolved (you must explain);
- you are in the military on active duty (they must wait until that is over);
- the time has passed to sue on the debt (which in NJ is six years from the time the debt was incurred); and/or
- the debt has been discharged in bankruptcy (which will be discussed below).

## Lining Up Your Defense

Though you do not need to file an Answer in Small Claims Court, if any of these same defenses apply to your situation, take note of them and be prepared on the day of court to prove them with either documentary evidence or through witness testimony—your own and possibly others’. If there is a necessary witness who is unwilling to come to court to testify on your behalf, you can Subpoena them. Subpoena forms are available at the office of the court clerk.

## Statute of Limitations

The defense that it is too late to collect on the debt is based on New Jersey’s Statute of Limitations, which allows six years to sue on any type of debt, including medical debt. If it has been longer than six years since the debt was incurred, the creditor may still contact you to try to get you to pay it but they cannot obtain a court judgment against you for the money. You must raise this defense in your Answer and cannot wait until the trial to mention it.

## Accord And Satisfaction Defense

Accord and Satisfaction is another possible defense that is generally available in a debt collection lawsuit though it is not listed in the Answer. It is available when there is a disputed debt and both sides agree to a different resolution that replaces the original debt, which is most often an agreement to pay a lesser amount. If you pay that amount or fulfill whatever your obligation is under the agreement, the creditor cannot sue you on the original obligation for the higher amount. As with all affirmative defense, the person being sued has the burden of proof. You must convince the court that you agreed with the creditor to pay a lower amount on a disputed debt and that you fulfilled your obligations under that agreement. If you entered into a reasonable Payment Plan and made all the payments, that would be an example of Accord and Satisfaction and would be a strong defense to a lawsuit over the same medical expenses.

## Medical Debt-Specific Defenses

There are other important defenses not specified on the Court’s Answer form that ARE specific to Medical Debt.

- If your medical debt has been reported to one of the three credit reporting agencies, the debt (if incurred after July 2024) is void, and no one can collect that money from you. You should check your credit report and if the debt is there, you must raise this as an affirmative defense (meaning that you have the burden to prove it) in order to make sure that New Jersey’s ban on reporting medical debt to credit reporting agencies protects you.
- If neither the hospital, physician, health care provider nor medical creditor or collection agency offered you a Reasonable Payment Plan or the Plan that they offered was not reasonable, this should be raised as a defense. Reasonable Payment Plans are discussed in Chapter 3.
- If you are on Medicaid or NJ Family Care, participating providers are not allowed to bill you for anything, with a few exceptions that are mainly for cosmetic procedures and other goods and services that are “not medically required for diagnosis or treatment of a disease, injury, or condition,” as specified in [N.J.A.C 10:49-5.5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-jersey/N-J-A-C-10-49-5-5).
- If the debt was incurred for hospital care, NJ law does not allow licensed hospitals, and the physicians who provide services to you in the hospital, to charge patients whose family gross income is below 500% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) more than 115% of the Medicare reimbursement rate for any service. If you qualify on income, you would have to determine if the charge was higher than 115% of the Medicare rate. Those rates can be found at the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services website](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/physician-fee-schedule/search/overview). You will need the billing code (CPT/HCPCS code) for the procedure to look up the rate. If you are insured and received an Explanation of Benefits, which is discussed in Chapter 3, Section 1, it should have the code. Otherwise, ask the hospital billing department for the billing code or codes that apply to your bill. _Note that if it turns out you were overcharged, you still have to pay some amount, but you will at least get a reduction from the amount billed._
- If the debt was incurred for hospital care, and you were found eligible for Charity Care, there is an argument to be made that any physician who provided health services at the hospital must accept Charity Care. See Chapter 2, section 1. Accordingly, if you are being sued by a physician who provided care at the hospital, you should raise as an affirmative defense that you were found eligible for Charity Care and are only responsible for a percentage of the bill if your income is between 200% and 300% of the FPL. Charity Care is discussed in Chapter 2 if you want more information about it.
- If the debt was incurred for hospital care, and your family gross income was below 300% of the FPL at the time you received hospital services, you may have been entitled to Charity Care if you also satisfied the asset test. If the hospital did no offer you a Charity Care application and you did not apply, and you were in fact eligible for it, the hospital -- and, arguably, any physician who treated you at the hospital -- may not collect payment from you. Accordingly, note that the hospital’s failure to give you the opportunity to apply for Charity Care is a valid defense and you should assert it.
- If the Plaintiff is not a health care provider but a debt buyer, you should take the position that they must prove that they do in fact own the debt and thus have a right to sue you for it. Even if you owe money for the health services, whoever sues you must prove that you owe the money to THEM. They will need paperwork showing that the debt was transferred to them. Please note that they cannot just show that they bought a list of accounts or debts from a health care provider or anyone else, but must specifically show that they bought YOUR account and that the debt they are suing you for is on that list. If they cannot do so, you should win the case.
- If the debt collector has violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), as discussed earlier in this Chapter, you can assert that violation as a Counterclaim in your Answer to the debt collection lawsuit, A Counterclaim differs from an Affirmative Defense (which attempts to defeat the Plaintiff’s claim against you by showing that you do not owe the debt) in that the CounterClaim is a new and separate claim by you against the Plaintiff based on their actions in trying to collect the debt and, if you prevail on the CounterClaim, the court can award you money to penalize them. Even if you owe the debt and the court finds that you do owe it, the amount of the judgment against you could be reduced by the amount you win on a successful FDCPA is even possible the Plaintiff could end up owing you money, if the amount you win on the Counterclaim is greater than the debt they were trying to collect from you. Note that Counterclaims are filed as part of the Answer and if your Answer contains a Counterclaim, [the filing fee increases from $30 to $50 (if your Counterclaim is for an amount of less than $5,000) or to $75 (if your Counterclaim amount is more than $5,000).](https://www.njcourts.gov/faq/what-fee-filing-answer-special-civil)

## Rights of those in the Military

If you are on active duty in the military, a federal law known as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act provides you with some protection. It applies to members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, National Guard, Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service who are deployed or on active duty, including annual training. The law allows you to temporarily stop (the legal term is “stay”) a lawsuit against you for at least 90 days while you are on active duty if you convince the court of three things: 1) that you have a defense to the claim; 2) that you cannot defend yourself unless you are physically present in court: and 3) that you have tried to appear in court but are unable to do so.

The law’s protections do not apply automatically. You must make the request in writing while you are on a tour of military service, or within 90 days after termination of or release from military service by sending the court a letter or other communication explaining: your military duties and the need for a stay, and the starting date for when you will be able to appear. You must include a letter from your commanding officer supporting the need for a stay.

If the request is denied and you do not show up in court or file the necessary documents, resulting in a Default Judgment against you, you cannot use the Service Members law to help you set aside the Default Judgment in the process discussed below. On the other hand, if you are on active duty and have not appeared in the case against you, the court cannot enter a Default Judgment against you until it appoints a lawyer to defend you.

There is a U.S. [Military website](https://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/#/home) where you can obtain records needed to prove your military status.

Additional information about the rights of those in the military can also be found on the websites of [Legal Services of New Jersey](https://www.lsnjlaw.org/legal-topics/military-veterans/service-members-civil/pages/civil-relief-act-aspx), which has a [Veterans Legal Assistance Project, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/educator-tools/servicemembers/the-servicemembers-civil-relief-act-scra/)

# What Else You Should Do—

## Keep Good Records

Hold onto any bills or receipts you have that shed light on whether you owe the debt, the amount of the debt and any payments made on the debt by you or the insurance company. You should also hold onto any communications from the debt collector and any notes you made about calls you received and what was said and any other forms and papers that relate to your case, including any papers that you file or receive from the debt collector or the court. You will need all of that if the case goes to trial.

## Find An Attorney

Get a lawyer if you can afford one and the amount of the debt (plus any other amounts they are seeking in the lawsuit) is large enough to make it worthwhile for you to pay the lawyer’s fees. The County Bar Association in your county should be able to provide you with a referral to a lawyer. If you cannot afford a lawyer, you can try to obtain free (also known as “pro bono”) legal help if your income is low enough to qualify. One possible source of assistance is Legal Services of New Jersey and there are also other groups that might be able to help in various counties. The Appendix contains names and contact information for some possible sources of free legal help, including those for the Legal Services offices located around the state.

## Ask Court Staff

In the absence of a lawyer, court staff can offer only minimal basic assistance. For instance, they can tell you how the court works and what is required for your case, provide court forms and instruct you how to fill them out and give you information from your case file but not much else. The court website has a [list](https://www.njcourts.gov/self-help/special-civil-court#toc-defending-yourself-in-a-suit) of some things that court staff can and cannot do to assist you.

Your most likely source of help is probably the court [Ombudsman](https://www.njcourts.gov/public/get-help/judiciary-ombudsman-program) for your county. A [list of the Ombudsman for each county](https://www.njcourts.gov/public/directories/court-services/ombudsman) with their contact information is available on the court website.

## Before Your Trial Begins--If Your Case is in Small Claims Court

If you are sued in Small Claims Court, you do not need to file an Answer. At the time you receive the Complaint in the case, you will also receive a Summons telling you the date, time and location of the trial. If you are unable to attend at that date and time, you must call the phone number on the Summons to request a different date. There is little or no downside to appearing in Small Claims Court to defend yourself. This is because the court will help you try to settle your case through a settlement conference prior to holding the trial. According to the New Jersey Court website: “A staff member will try to help the plaintiff and the defendant reach an agreement.”

## Before Your Trial Begins -- If Your Case is in Special Civil Part

After you file your Answer in Special Civil Part, one of two things can happen: 1) the other side might make a Motion for “Summary Judgment” (essentially asking the court to decide the case without holding a trial based on the argument that the evidence is sufficiently strong and undisputed to do so); or 2) the court will notify you of a Trial Date. If you cannot make the date for reasons beyond your control, you must contact the Plaintiff and ask for their consent to reschedule it. You should then let the court know about the Plaintiff’s response and request a new date. In the event that the other side makes a Motion for Summary Judgment, you should respond, at minimum, with a Certification denying facts that the Plaintiff/Creditor says are undisputed but with which you do not agree and setting forth facts that you think are relevant that the other side did not mention. If you do not respond or create a dispute about the facts in the case, the judge will rule in favor of the Plaintiff/Creditor and you will not have the opportunity for a trial, or for a court-ordered settlement conference that usually precedes a trial. Again, this may be a good time to try to find an attorney who can help you oppose the Motion for Summary Judgment.

Prior to trial in Special Civil Part, the parties in a case are entitled to seek information from each other related to the claims and defenses in the case in a process known as “Discovery.” The type of Discovery, if any, that you are most likely to see in a lawsuit to collect Medical Debt is “Interrogatories”—a series of questions related to the case that must be answered in writing and returned to the Plaintiff (or by them to you) within 30 days. If you do not answer the Interrogatories, the court could throw out your Answer and you would have to file a motion and pay a $25 filing fee to reinstate it or face the possibility of a Default Judgment against you. If you serve Interrogatories on the Plaintiff and they fail to answer them on time, the case could be thrown out, but they could likewise seek to reinstate it.

Another possible type of Discovery that you need to be aware of is known as a “Request for Admission,” in which the other side sends you a request to admit to the truth of certain “facts” and/or to the authenticity of specific documents related to the case (which will be attached to the Request). If the facts they state are true and the documents authentic, you must file a Response to the Request for Admission admitting to that. If, on the other hand, any of the facts are not true or one or more documents is not authentic, you must state that also in your response. You have 30 days to respond unless you get an extension in the same way as for answering the Complaint. Note that despite the 30-day deadline for responding to a Request for Admission, you are not required to file your response sooner than 45 days if they serve the Request for Admission at the same time they serve you with the Summons and Complaint, as is not uncommon.

If you are unable to admit or deny, you must still respond and explain why. It is not enough to claim lack of information or knowledge. You must first undertake a “reasonable inquiry” into the matter and then say that a “reasonable inquiry” was made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable an admission or denial.

If you do not deny an incorrect statement of alleged fact or document within the time limit, the court may deem those facts admitted at trial and those documents to be genuine, even if they are not. Or if you fail to admit or dispute a fact and the Plaintiff proves the fact or document at trial, there is a slight chance that the court might make you pay them the cost of doing so. Accordingly, do not dispute a document if you know that the document is accurate.

The bottom line is you need to respond to all questions in the Request for Admissions, respond by the deadline, and deny any things presented that are not true or that you think might not be true as well as admit those that are. If you miss the deadline to respond, ask the court to give you more time

## Requesting Documents from the Plaintif

Getting documents from the other side is also an important part of Discovery. You should have checked the box on the Answer form asking for everything mentioned in the Complaint but if you failed to do so or came to realize that there are additional documents not mentioned in the Complaint that you need, you can ask the Court to require the Plaintiff to provide them. You will probably have to submit a written “Request for Production of Documents” and the Plaintiff would then have to provide the documents within 30 days. Often information that you receive during Discovery can assist you in overcoming a Motion for Summary Judgment.

No Discovery or document exchange is available in Small Claims Court. Rather, you must show up in Court and be prepared to present evidence and arguments to support any defenses you have to the lawsuit.

## Accessibility Assistance

If you have a disability that could make it difficult to take part in court proceedings—for example, if you need a wheelchair or have a hearing impairment, you should contact the local [Court ADA (Americans with Disability Act) coordinator](https://www.njcourts.gov/public/directories/court-services/ada-II) beforehand to obtain an accommodation of your disability.

## Language Translation Assistance

If you do not speak English, you should notify the local Court as soon as possible to [request an interpreter](https://www.njcourts.gov/public/get-help/request-interpreter) for when you are in court.

## Rescheduling a Court Date

As with other deadlines in the lawsuit, if you cannot make the scheduled trial date, you should ask the Plaintiff/Creditor to agree to a delay and if they do, confirm it with them in writing and let the court know. If they do not agree, you can still ask the court for a later date and the court will probably grant your request if you have a good reason.

## What to Expect on Trial Day

On the day of trial, before it begins, a judge assigned to the case by the Court in Special Civil Part will ask both sides to sit down with a Mediator and try to reach a settlement of the case. You can also try to settle the case before the trial date on your own or the Plaintiff’s lawyer might find you in the courtroom hallway on the day of trial and try to work out a deal. Keep in mind that their lawyer is only looking out for their interests and not yours. No matter what their lawyer tells you, they are not there to help you and may be taking unfair advantage of you or even misrepresenting things to you. You have the right to appear before the judge to force the creditor to try the case and for you to present any defenses or counterclaims you have.

## Settlement Agreements

If you do decide to reach a settlement agreement, try to drive a hard bargain by explaining any defenses or counterclaims that you would raise before a judge. Make sure that you can pay any amount that you agree to in a settlement. Sometimes it is better to agree to one lump sum payment up front if you can afford it, instead of a payment plan that you may not be able to pay in the future and which will ultimately bring you back to court if you fail to pay.

If the Plaintiff agrees to dismiss the case or you reach a settlement agreement with their lawyer, you should still go to court to file an appearance to make sure that the creditor dismisses the case. If there is a settlement agreement, the safest course is to file a copy of the written settlement agreement with the court clerk to be entered into the court record. No deal should include a judgment being entered against you unless you have no defenses and the settlement is for only a portion of the debt owed. A judgment being entered against you is a very dangerous thing—this can lead to your bank account being frozen and the amount owed being taken out of your account very quickly. Your wages could also be garnished if you make more than six times the Federal Poverty Level, or $93,900, as discussed in Section 4 of this Chapter on Enforcement of Judgments.

If you are not represented by a lawyer, you may need help to determine if a settlement is fair and reasonable. Never agree to anything you do not understand or that you think is unfair. Try to reach out to a Legal Services attorney, at minimum, to discuss the reasonableness of the settlement or discuss the settlement with a family member or friend.

## The Trial

If you are unable to settle the case, it will go to trial which will result in a verdict for or against you. Trials in Special Civil Part and Small Claims Court do not usually take longer than a day. You must show up prepared with evidence to defend against the lawsuit, including documents and witnesses, if any. _A written statement from a witness will not be allowed by the court; the witness must show up in person to testify._ You must also be prepared to challenge the Plaintiff’s evidence if it does not prove their claim, for example, if it does not show that they actually own the specific debt for which they sued you. They must have the paperwork! And if you are counterclaiming for a violation of the FDCPA, bring the paperwork that proves that. including any notes you made of harassing calls or other improper collection efforts.

Do not be afraid to be forceful, but do not make personal attacks on individuals, including lawyers, witnesses, or the judge. A display of anger will usually hurt you more than it helps.

If you can, bring a friend or family member to provide emotional support, give feedback, help you keep track of documents and provide a second opinion if you have to respond to a settlement offer on the spot.

Judges are very busy and you cannot assume they read the documents beforehand, including your Answer. At trial, be prepared to explain your position in a clear, concise and organized way. Make sure to mention all your defenses and counterclaims.

## Organize Yourself Ahead of Time

It is easy to get flustered in a courtroom before a judge so before trial, write up a chronological list of events, as well as a checklist of the points you want to make and the documents you want to give to the judge (bring the originals if you have them but if not, a copy will have to do) and remember to bring the report and documents to court with you. Judges may be impatient if you are disorganized.

## If You Lose Your Case

If you lose the case, the judge will issue a Judgment against you, ordering you to pay a certain amount, which will be higher than the debt alone because it will also include court costs and possibly legal fees. There will also be interest on the total amount, if you do not pay right away. The court decides the rate of interest but as of July 2025, state law limits the interest to no more than 3%.
