# Section 1: Credit Reporting of Medical Debt

As a general rule, if you fail to pay your bills, your failure to pay can be reported to a credit reporting agency and hurt your credit score. People with a low credit score can have difficulty renting an apartment, or buying a car or a house, or obtaining a loan. In some cases, a low score can even keep you from getting a job if the employer does a credit check before hiring.

In 2023, the three major credit bureaus, Equifax, Trans Union, and Experian, removed medical debt under $500 from credit reports and on January 7, 2025, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a new federal rule that bans reporting medical debt of any amount on credit reports and prohibits lenders from using medical information in making loan decisions. As of Spring 2025, the rule was scheduled to take effect on June 15, 2025, but its future is uncertain because it is being challenged in court and the Trump Administration will probably not defend it.

New Jersey has its own state law, the [Louisa Carman Medical Debt Relief Act](https://pub.njleg.state.nj.us/Bills/2024/PL24/48_.PDF), passed in 2024, that bans the reporting of most medical debt. There are some exceptions to the ban – mainly for medical debt that is paid for with a regular credit card or is paid for with a special medical credit card if that card is also used to pay for anything other than medical care, including veterinarian or wellness services. Note that, unlike the federal rule, the New Jersey law does not prohibit taking into account medical information, including medical debts, in making loan decisions but the reporting ban will of course make it harder for lenders to learn about the existence of such information.

The New Jersey law includes enforcement measures to stop debt collectors from violating the ban and reporting the debt anyway or threatening to report it in order to pressure you to pay--it essentially wipes the debt and your responsibility to pay the reported amount, from the books. In legal terms, the debt becomes void automatically if it is reported, which means you do not need to pay it. If the entire debt was not reported, then only the part that was reported is void. The law also contains a requirement that debt collectors have to tell you that they did not report the debt and that if they did, the debt can no longer be collected.

It is important to check to make sure that your debt was not reported so that you do not pay a medical debt that you are no longer legally obligated to pay. Before paying any medical debt, you should contact at least one of the three major credit bureaus to be sure that it has not been reported in violation of the law. The agencies are Equifax (888-378-4329), Experian (888-397-3742) and TransUnion (800-916-8800).

In addition to calling, you may request a free copy of your credit report from [annualcreditreport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action) or by calling 877-322-8228. You are allowed to request a free report from each of the three major credit bureaus listed above once per year

Look closely at your report to make sure the information is correct. Medical debt will generally appear in one of two places:

- Check the “Account Information” or “Collections” section of the report.
- Check the section that “Flags” new debt.

If your credit report contains paid or unpaid medical debt, follow [these instructions](https://pirg.org/articles/how-make-sure-your-credit-reports-dont-include-paid-medical-debt-0/) to dispute any errors. [The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-dispute-an-error-on-my-credit-report-en-314/) (“CFPB”) website also has detailed information about how to do this, including contact information for the different credit reporting companies, along with information about how to file a complaint with the CFPB about a problem with a credit report. Instructions with template letters to be written to the creditor and the credit reporting agency are provided at this link.

[A complaint can also be filed](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/Pages/Consumer-Complaints.aspx) with the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs over medical debt reported in violation of the Louisa Carman Medical Debt Relief Act, or other violations of that law, and the state Attorney General can assess civil penalties and order the return of any money obtained through such violations.

Other sites beyond the major credit bureaus may offer a credit report, but they may ask for a fee, show you ads, or could be an outright scam to [steal your personal information](https://pirg.org/resources/protecting-yourself-identity-theft/). So be careful!
