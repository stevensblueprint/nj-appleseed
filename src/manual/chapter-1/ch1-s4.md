# Section 4: Seeking Preventive, Routine and Specialty Care at a Doctorâ€™s Office

For some people, medical care consists of annual check-ups with a primary care physician and/or gynecologist, and occasional referrals for preventive or diagnostic tests. For others, with chronic diseases or mental health issues, scheduling an appointment with a physician, psychologist or specialist is much more routine and occurs more often.

As we discussed earlier in this Chapter, it is as important in scheduling doctor appointments as it is for arranging hospital care to understand your health insurance policy, what is covered and what is not and the extent of coverage and, correspondingly, what share of the cost you will be expected to pay in the form of deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance. You must also be aware of when referrals and pre-authorizations are needed and ALWAYS check to be sure that a provider is in-network so that you do not end up responsible for costs that you thought were covered or with a Surprise Medical Bill. The provider is required to let you know of their innetwork or out-of-network status. If they are out-of-network, then they have to ask you to sign a consent form acknowledging that you know they are out-of-network and are willing to receive services from them anyway and at a higher than in-network cost.

If an in-network provider does a blood test, imaging test or other type of test done in their office, they cannot send it to an out-of-network lab for analysis, so in this situation, you need not worry about a Surprise Medical Bill. But if they send you elsewhere to get the blood test or other test done, then you must check beforehand to be sure that where they send you is in-network. You cannot assume that anywhere an in-network doctor sends you will also be in-network. And you should not agree to receive testing or other services from a provider whose network status you do not know.

## WHEN A SPECIALTY SERVICE PROVIDER IS OUT-OF-NETWORK

If you cannot find an in-network provider, which is more likely to happen with mental health services and some specialty areas of practice, ask your insurance company if you can see somebody who is out-of-network at in-network rates. They will try to find a provider for you within a certain distance of where you live. If they do not, they should grant your request. However, if they do deny your request, you can appeal that denial, as discussed above regarding denial of benefits.

## PAYING YOUR MEDICAL BILL

Following the provision of services by a health care provider, you will be presented with a bill for your share of the cost, probably at least a co-pay and perhaps some cost-sharing (known as co-insurance) as well, especially if you have not yet met your deductible. They will probably expect you to pay that amount on the spot. You might be tempted to pay it with your credit card. If you do, be aware that your debt becomes credit card debt and is not protected by a recent New Jersey law that prohibits the reporting of medical debt to credit agencies, limits the interest charged on medical debt to no more than 3% and only allows garnishment of your wages to collect a medical debt if you make more than six times the [Federal Poverty Level](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines) (FPL), which is $93,900 for 2025 (6 x FPL of $15,650).

An additional factor to consider is that you are less likely to be sued for medical debt than for credit card debt. Also, health care providers are often more willing to reduce the amount of a delinquent debt if you can show financial hardship. Once you put the debt on a credit card, you lose those opportunities.

Your doctor might encourage you to sign up for a special credit card to pay for medical bills but be aware that these cards are usually not a good choice for this purpose because they often have high interest rates (though they might lure you in with an initial low rate) or unfavorable terms. You also lose the option of negotiating with your health care provider over the bill and it turns your medical debt into credit card debt, with all the lost protections described above. You should exercise similar caution regarding other forms of medical financing or loans that might be offered by your doctor, hospital or a third-party lender.

Accordingly, if you can pay your co-pay in cash, you should do so, and ask for a bill with respect to any other expected payment.
