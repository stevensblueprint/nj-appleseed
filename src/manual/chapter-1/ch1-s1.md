# Section 1: Understanding Your Plan—Co-pays, Co-insurance, Authorization, Appealing Denial of Benefits or Coverage

If you have health insurance, you should have an ID card, which contains
important information about your plan. This section will help you understand
what the card says and what it means or coverage under your plan.

The information contained on the card typically includes:

- Your Name (or your spouse’s if you are on their employer’s plan and will likely also have the name of that employer)
- Name of Insurance Company
- Name and Phone Number of Primary Care Physician (PCP) if your plan requires you to have one.
- Type of Plan – HMO, POS, PPO, self-funded, Medicare, Medicaid/NJ Family Care, Veterans Health Benefit Plan, State Health Benefit Plan or NJ School Employees’ Health Benefit Plan
- Your Insurance Policy ID Number (if in a managed care policy)
- Your Insurance Group Number (if you are insured through an employer)
- Your individual Medicare or Medicaid number
- Additional numbers pertaining to pharmaceutical coverage: Rx Bin, Rx PCH, Rx Grp
- Deductible Amounts—Typically, separate amounts for in-network and out-of-network, each of which must be met separately. The out-of-network deductible tends to be higher.
- Co-Pays for various types of services, such as Office Visit, Specialist Visit and Emergency Room Visit
- Co-Insurance or Co-Share—Typically not included on the insurance ID card but sometimes indicated in the name of the Plan. For example, United Healthcare’s Choice Plus 90 plan indicates that it pays 90% of covered, in-network charges and the insured pays the remaining 10%.
- Phone numbers (usually on the back) for members to contact the health insurer, with separate contact number for providers.

## ID CARD GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Here is what the terms mentioned above mean:

### TYPES OF PLANS

Fully-Funded Plans (HMO. PPO, POS)—Most insurers have some sort of limitation on the health
care providers you can see and still obtain insurance benefits.

**HMO**: The most restrictive plans are HMOs or Health Maintenance Organizations where, other than in an emergency, there is generally no coverage if you see a doctor who is outside of the insurance company’s network or not part of the HMO. You will probably have to pay the charge in full for such providers.

**PPO**: In a Preferred Provider Organization plan, you pay less for providers who are in the insurance company’s network but you can use out-of-network providers without a referral for an additional cost. It is the most flexible type of plan but also tends to be the most expensive.

**POS**: A Point of Service plan is like a PPO except that your Primary Care Physician (PCP) must provide a referral for any visit to a specialist or out-of-network provider.

**Self-Funded Plan**: These are plans that are financed by a private sector employer and administered by a health insurance company. They are governed by the provisions of the federal [“Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,”](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title29/chapter18&edition=prelim) also known as ERISA, and are not regulated by state law.

**Government Plans**: Medicare, Medicaid, NJ FamilyCare, Veterans Health Benefits, State Health Benefits Program, and School Employees Health Benefit Program

**Medicare**: The [federal Medicare program](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title42/html/USCODE-2011-title42-chap7-subchapXVIII.htm), which covers people who are 65 or older or who have certain disabilities or conditions

**Medicaid**: [The State Medicaid program](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/title-30/section-30-4d-1/), which covers people with low incomes, pregnant women and children.

**NJ FamilyCare**: A comprehensive, federal- and state-funded health insurance program created to provide income-qualified New Jersey residents, of any age, who do not have employer insurance, with access to affordable health insurance. It includes the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Medicaid and Medicaid expansion populations.

**Veterans Health Benefits Plans**: Veterans Health Care and all insurance programs that make up TRICARE, the healthcare program for the U.S. armed services. It covers active duty service members and their families, National Guard and Reserve members and their families; and retirees and their families.

**State Health Benefits Program (“SHBP”) and School Employees’ Health Benefits Program (“SEHBP”):** The programs cover active state employees and local school board employees and their dependents. Learn more about SHBP [here](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/pensions/hb-active-shbp.shtml) and about SEHBP [here](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/pensions/hb-active-sehbp.shtml).

## IMPORTANT PLAN TERMS

**Deductibles**—A deductible is the amount the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurer is required to pay anything and it resets annually so you have to meet it again each year. There are two main types of deductibles—for in-network and for out-of- network care, usually with a separate deductible for each person covered by the plan and for a family plan, a deductible that applies to the entire family. If the deductible has not been satisfied and you incur medical charges, you have to pay the entire amount of the charge until the deductible for that year is reached (although you still get the benefit of any reduced charge that the insurance company has negotiated with the health provider for that particular type of service). Even when you have fully satisfied the in-network deductible, if you incur charges for care from an out-of-network provider, you must satisfy the out-ofnetwork deductible separately. That is a good reason to stay in-network on top of the fact that even after the deductible is met and coverage kicks in, your insurer might cover a lower percentage of out-of-network costs—maybe 60 or 70% rather than 90%, for example.

##### **NOTE** that deductibles do not apply to preventive testing/care, which are always covered in full, although you might be required to utilize in-network providers testing facilities or laboratories.

**Co-Pay**—A co-pay is a set fee that you pay every time you see a doctor or other health provider or pick up a prescription. It can vary with the type of health care or the type of prescription, ranging from as low as $0 to $50 or more for a regular office visit, but usually higher for a specialist and it tends to be higher still, as much as $100 or more, for an emergency room visit. Your ID card might also specify a co-pay for Urgent Care visits, which are increasingly replacing Emergency Room visits for times when medical care is needed right away for injuries or illnesses that are not serious enough to warrant a visit to the E.R.

Under the Affordable Care Act, or ACA (also widely referred to as “Obamacare”), which became law in 2010, no co-pay whatsoever can be charged for certain types of preventive care, including vaccinations, mammograms and colonoscopies. A major caveat is that if the test is not just being done as part of regular, periodic screening, but to diagnose a suspected illness or condition, perhaps because of symptoms that are present, the testing is no longer deemed preventive and the usual deductibles and co-pays apply.

**Co-Insurance (also known as Co-Share)**—It is the percentage of a covered expense that a patient pays after meeting their deductible. It is a way for the patient and their insurance provider to share the cost of a service. For example, if the insurer pays 80%, you pay the other 20% (it can be higher or lower depending on your plan) and that 20% share is referred to as co-insurance. If a provider is out-of-network, the insurer might still cover the charges, but usually pays a lesser portion, maybe 70% or 50%, leaving you with a co-insurance obligation of 30% or 50%.

**Out-of-Pocket Maximum\***—Whether or not it is indicated on your insurance ID card, most plans have an annual out-of-pocket maximum, and after you meet that amount, all of your eligible care should be 100% covered for the rest of the year. Deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance all count toward the out-of-pocket maximum.

## Pre-authorization/Prior Authorization/Pre-Approval

Your insurance card will not mention pre-authorization, prior authorization or pre-approval (which are all the same thing) but there will almost certainly be at least some health care services, procedures, providers or prescriptions that require it. If you go ahead and have the service or procedure, see the provider or fill the prescription without such approval, it might not be covered at all. If you are in any doubt about whether pre-authorization is required even if your doctor or the health care facility involved has obtained such approval on your behalf, make sure by calling the phone number for members on the back of your insurance ID card and confirming it for yourself or obtain a copy of the plan itself from your insurer or employer to check what it says. It is also a good idea to confirm whether a particular provider, lab or testing facility is in-network or out-ofnetwork, in order to keep medical costs down. Again, call the insurance company and do not rely on a printed or online directory, which might be out-of-date. The provider, whether a lab, hospital or physician, is supposed to inform you whether they are in-network with your insurance plan.

A new state law, known as the **[Ensuring Transparency in Prior Authorization Act](https://pub.njleg.state.nj.us/Bills/2022/PL23/296_.PDF)**,  
which went into effect on January 1, 2025, provides some protections for the pre-authorization process:

- Insurers have to decide urgent pre-authorization requests for medication within **24 hours** of receiving the necessary documentation and within **72 hours** for non-urgent requests.
- Prior authorization for treatment of a long-term or chronic condition is to remain valid for **180 days** unless a shorter time frame is necessary to monitor patient safety or treatment effectiveness.
- The decision to deny or limit treatment has to be made by a **doctor** and one who is in the **same specialty** that usually treats that condition or disease.
- If you had prior authorization for treatment, you do not lose it when you switch insurance companies. The new company has to honor that prior authorization for at least **60 days** under the new plan.
- Denials of pre-authorization for inpatient or outpatient hospital services must be provided within **12 days** if the request was submitted on paper or **9 days** if submitted electronically. If the patient/insured is already hospitalized, a denial must be within **24 hours** and no later than **72 hours** for a claim involving urgent care, unless the hospital or health care provider fails to provide sufficient information.
- For care that is medically necessary to screen and stabilize a patient in an **emergency situation**, coverage is required without prior authorization.

## Dual Insurance

Some people might be covered by more than one insurance policy. Both policies might be coextensive, providing general health coverage. Examples are: a person might be covered by their own employer plan and their spouse’s; children might be covered by both parents’ plans; someone might have both an employer plan and a government-sponsored plan such as Medicare or Medicaid, or both Medicaid and Medicare (known as a Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan or D-SNP). Sometimes, people have supplemental policies that cover expenses for dental or vision. For those with auto insurance, Personal Injury Protection provides coverage for crash-related injuries.

With two policies, one is primary, meaning it pays first and covers a larger portion of the bill while the secondary plan covers remaining eligible costs. Claims processing can be more complicated and there is a coordination of benefits (COB) process to determine which plan pays first and how much.

It is crucial to communicate with both insurers to understand their COB provisions and ensure proper coordination. It is also essential to make sure that your health provider knows that you have dual coverage so that they can seek payment from both and maximize the insurance benefits available to you before sending you a bill for any remaining balance.

## Affordable Care Act Rights and Protections

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, usually referred to more briefly as “The Affordable Care Act” (ACA) or “Obamacare,” was signed into law in 2010 and has been in effect for more than a decade. It is mostly thought of as a law that increased the number of people with health insurance but it did more than that in increasing protections for everyone with health insurance.

Probably the most well-known provisions are those that: allow children under 26 to stay on their parents’ policies; prohibit deductibles or co-pays for preventive care and testing; and bar insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, cancer or pregnancy) or charging more or limiting benefits for them.

**Essential Care Coverage**—The ACA also defines certain health services listed below as essential and requires that they be included in every health insurance policy:

1. Ambulatory care
2. Emergency services
3. Hospitalization
4. Pregnancy, maternity and newborn care — includes contraception, breastfeeding support, counseling and equipment such as pumps, all without co-pays or deductibles
5. Mental health and substance abuse disorder services
6. Prescription drugs
7. Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices
8. Laboratory services
9. Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management (asthma, diabetes, etc.)
10. Dental and vision care for children (but **NOT** for adults)

## Surprise Medical Bills and How to Avoid Them: Your Rights under State and Federal Law

What is a “Surprise Medical Bill”?—A “Surprise Medical Bill” is an unexpected bill from an outof-network health provider or out-of-network facility such as a hospital, clinic or laboratory, that you did not knowingly and deliberately chose to treat you. The “surprise” can come from getting any bill at all because you thought you were covered in full or from getting a bill that is higher (sometimes considerably higher) than expected, because your insurer provided lower coverage due to the provider’s out-of-network status. Surprise Medical Bills are also sometimes referred to as “Balance Billing” because when the insurer pays the provider the lower, out-of-network amount, the provider looks to the patient to pay the rest by sending them a bill for the balance of the amount charged.

Surprise Billing occurs primarily in two circumstances: 1) when an insured patient receives emergency care either at an out-of-network facility or from an out-of-network provider working in an in-network facility or 2) when a patient receives elective non-emergency care at an in-network facility but is treated by an out-of-network health care provider that they did not choose. One common scenario is having surgery done by an in-network provider at an in-network hospital, but the anesthesiologist turns out not to be in-network or having an in-network provider do a medical test that is then sent to an out-ofnetwork lab. Since the insurer does not have a contract with the out-of-network facility, provider or lab, it may decide not to pay the entire bill. In that case, the out-of-network facility or provider may bill the patient for the balance of the bill. These are all considered to be Surprise Medical Bills. A bill for your co-insurance obligation, or a bill for the higher out-of-network amount if you knowingly choose out-of-network care is known as Balance Billing but is not considered a “surprise” bill.

## Federal and State Law Protections

Both federal and New Jersey state law have protections against Surprise Medical Bills or inadvertent out-of-network charges for emergency and non-emergency services. The most crucial difference between the federal and state law is that the federal No Surprises Act, enacted in 2020 and effective as of January 1, 2022, applies to almost all health insurance policies, while the New Jersey law, The Out-of-Network Consumer Protection, Transparency, Cost Containment, and Accountability Act, enacted in 2018, applies only to insurance policies that are governed by New Jersey law and only to the extent that the state law provides protection beyond that provided by the federal law. State-regulated plans include those sold on the Affordable Care Act’s individual and small-group marketplaces, the State Health Benefits and School Employees Health Benefits Plan and fully-insured employer-sponsored plans. They do not include employersponsored plans that are self-insured, meaning the employer’s money is used to pay claims and an insurance company simply administers the coverage. These plans are governed solely by federal law.

Neither the federal nor the state out-of-network law applies to Medicare (including Medicare Advantage), or New Jersey Family Care/Medicaid (including Medicaid managed care plans), the Indian Health Service, Veterans Health Care, and insurance programs that make up TRICARE, all of which generally prohibit balance billing with some limited exceptions. If the state law is more protective of consumers than the federal law, its requirement prevails with respect to plans regulated by New Jersey, so if you are a member of a state-regulated plan, you can look to the state law as well as the federal law for protection. Though it should be noted that the claims processing and arbitration provisions of the New Jersey law apply only when the out-of-network services are by a New Jersey licensed provider in a New Jersey health care facility (with a limited exception for laboratory tests sent out of state for analysis). They do not apply if you have a New Jersey regulated plan, but received services out of the state. In those situations, only the federal law applies.

You cannot waive your rights under either law. This means that you can only lose the protection against balance billing in a non-emergency situation if you make a deliberate decision to receive services from an out-of-network provider, and sign a document saying that. If a provider discloses their out-of-network status to you just at the time of service and has you sign a consent to receive their services without noting in writing that they are an out-of-network provider, that is not sufficient. Under New Jersey law, you must receive notice of the providers’ out-of-network status at the time you schedule the appointment; not the day you show up. Under federal law, you must receive notice of out-of-network status at least 72 hours prior to the delivery of services, and at least 3 hours beforehand if you make the appointment the same day as you receive treatment. You also must be given a plain-language written notice, which includes disclosures of applicable billing protections, among other things, and must sign consent forms to receive out-of-network services BEFORE receiving such out-of-network services.

In addition, all New Jersey insurance carriers that provide managed care within a network are required to:

- maintain up-to-date lists on their website of in-network providers;
- provide clear and detailed information regarding how voluntary out-of-network services are covered for plans that feature out-of-network coverage;
- provide examples of out-of-network costs and provide treatment-specific information on estimated costs when requested by a covered person; and
- maintain a telephone hotline to answer questions.

All health care facilities are obligated to put information on their website about billing, in-network status, etc.

## GROUND AND AIR AMBULANCE SERVICE

A major gap in both the state and federal law is that neither applies to ground ambulance services. The federal law, however, does cover transportation by air ambulances and it applies in New Jersey.

## BILLING DISPUTES

If you believe that you have been wrongly billed by an out-of-network provider that you did not knowingly and deliberately select to treat you, you should immediately call your insurance company and discuss the situation to confirm that you have wrongfully been billed. You also may contact the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance at:

## APPEALING THE DENIAL OF BENEFITS

_It is always important to know the type of plan you have and the specifics of your plan so that you know whether you need to get a referral before you seek medical treatment_, whether certain medical services that you desire or that your physician has recommended are covered and/or considered medically necessary, the amount of co-insurance you will be responsible to pay and other questions. But no matter how well you understand your plan, there will be times when your insurance company denies coverage or limits the amount they will pay for your care. If this happens, regardless of what type of plan you have, you have the right to appeal the company’s decision. _You have a certain amount of time to do so, which varies with the type of insurance from as little as 60 days to as long as 180 days from the date you receive a “denial” letter_. **Once you receive the letter, you should call your insurance company as soon as possible and find out the details of the appeal process.**
