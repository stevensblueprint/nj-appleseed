# Section 3: Seeking Care at a Hospital-Owned Facility

You should always call your insurance company to confirm whether both the facility and the physician providing the health service are in-network prior to scheduling care at a hospital, outpatient clinic, or ambulatory care facility owned by a hospital system, whether for preventive care, such as a colonoscopy, or for a surgery, MRI or other procedure. If the procedure requires sedation, you should also ask if about the anesthesiologist too. Even though the hospital and physician you call when scheduling the treatment are required to inform you whether they are in-network, your insurance company is required to maintain a list of in-network providers, and the hospital must list which insurance it accepts on its website, it is always safest to call and speak to an insurance representative to be certain. Websites are often unreliable and out-of-date and you should not rely on them.

Once you have confirmed that the facility and physician performing the surgery or other procedure are in-network, the hospital must provide any ancillary services to you at an in-network level both under New Jersey and federal law. Such ancillary services might include laboratory testing, radiologic imaging and even the food the hospital provides to admitted patients.

You always have the option to select an out-of-network provider. But you will only incur out-of-network charges if you decide to have them after being informed they will cost more and signing a consent form that indicates you want to receive services from this provider even though they are out-of-network. That form must be signed at least 72 hours prior to receiving the services, or at least 3 hours beforehand, if you make the appointment the same day you intend to receive the services.

## FACILITY FEES

At the time of scheduling your treatment, you should also determine whether the hospital-owned facility will be charging a facility fee in addition to the bill you will be receiving for medical services. Sometimes health insurance plans do not cover facility fees, or they only cover part of a facility fee. Call the location where you plan to receive care and ask if you will be charged a facility fee. If the answer is “yes,” call your health insurance company to see if they will fully cover this expense. If your insurer will not fully cover a facility fee, ask your physician or insurer to help you find an alternative location that will not charge these added fees

## MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

Sometimes, following treatment, you will need additional care or medical equipment. If you are unsure of whether or not you need medical equipment—or if that equipment is covered by your insurance—ask the health care worker who is discharging you to verify if medical equipment and/or follow-up care is necessary as well as its associated out-of-pocket costs. Then speak to your insurance company, and if your coverage is insufficient, ask them for ways you can keep equipment or follow-up care costs to a minimum.

## SCHEDULED CARE

For any care that is scheduled in advance—like an endoscopy, X-ray or non-emergency surgery—you may also ask your health insurance company to provide an estimate of what you will owe. This is referred to as an “Advance Explanation of Benefits.” The plan may provide this estimate in writing, but they are not required to do so. If you get an estimate, be sure to compare it with the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that you will receive after you receive your scheduled care. Ask your insurance plan to explain anything that does not match up.

In addition, under the Federal Hospital Price Transparency final rule implementing Section 2718(e) of the Public Health Service Act, every hospital operating in the United States is required to provide clear, accessible pricing information on their website regarding the items and services they provide (1) as a comprehensive machine-readable file; and (2) in a display of shop-able services in a consumer-friendly format. Such information may also be helpful to you when deciding in which facility you will have your treatment. Additional information is available at [Federal Hospital Price Transparency FAQ](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/hospital-price-transparency-frequently-asked-questions.pdf).

Because you are receiving care at a hospital-owned facility, you may be eligible for Charity Care even though you are insured. New Jersey mandates that all acute care hospitals, whether nonprofit or for-profit, provide a 100% discount for residents with incomes at or below 200% of the FPL, and discounted care for patients with incomes between 200% and 300% of the FPL. If insured, Charity Care can be used to pay the portion of the hospital bill that your insurer does not pay, including co-pays and co-insurance.
