# CHAPTER ONE: RIGHTS OF INSURED PATIENTS

This chapter is for those who have health insurance of some kind â€“ private insurance through
your job or an individual policy bought on an insurance exchange, or through some public program
like NJ FamilyCare, Medicaid or Medicare. Any kind of insurance is better than none, but policies
differ not just in the monthly premiums you pay but also in: what benefits they provide and the
scope of coverage, including the size of deductibles and co-pays; on pre-approval requirements;
which providers are in or out of network; and what drugs are covered.
