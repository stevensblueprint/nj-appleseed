# Section 2: Seeking Emergency Care

Emergency Rooms at acute care hospitals are required to provide you treatment in an emergency regardless of your insurance status or ability to pay. Under federal law, regardless of whether you have an outstanding bill, a hospital is not allowed to turn you away in an emergency situation, which includes being in labor if you are pregnant. This right to emergency care is required by a federal law known as the [Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act or EMTALA](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act). _(It should be noted, that under New Jersey law, an acute care hospital cannot turn you away in a nonemergency situation as well. This requirement is known as Charity Care and is discussed elsewhere in this Chapter and in Chapter 2)_.

## AMBULANCE TRANSPORT

You are at home, on the road or at work and an accident occurs and you or someone in your family is seriously injured or you have a heart attack, stroke or are in a condition that needs immediate treatment. You call 911 and thanks to the federal and state laws discussed above that protect against Surprise Medical Bills, you do not have to worry about out-of-network charges at whatever Emergency Room you go to. Ambulance transport services are a different story, because those Surprise Medical Bill protections do not apply to ground ambulances, only air ambulances. You are at risk of a Surprise Medical Bill for the ambulance ride unless you get lucky and the town from which you are calling 911 provides Emergency Medical Services (EMS) or emergency ambulance transport and has agreed not to Balance Bill any insured patient beyond co-pays or co-insurance, as some towns have done.

## FACILITIES

If a family member or neighbor is able to transport the “patient” without using ambulance services, they should go to the nearest hospital, hospital satellite emergency room, ambulatory care center, or ambulatory surgical center. Emergency care should not be sought from an urgent care center, because the protections against Surprise Medical Bills do not apply to them. Urgent care centers, which may be able to treat a broken arm or serious burn, are best used to provide routine care to you at your convenience, without an appointment, although they and their physicians are often out-of-network providers. If you are transported to a hospital, satellite emergency room, etc., you are protected whether the hospital is in-network or not; all services rendered under these emergency circumstances are charged to you as if they were provided by an in-network facility and/ or provider. If the facility and/or the provider contest the payment made by your insurer, they are able to file for arbitration. You, the patient will only be responsible for co-pays and co-insurance at in-network rates and will not be involved in such arbitration.

Once you are in a hospital, there will come a time that treatment to address the emergency ends. This can be as short as hours or as long as days. If you were brought to a facility that is not in-network and you still require additional care, you will be asked to either consent to out-ofnetwork billing, or you will be asked to leave the hospital and seek further services at an in-network health care facility. At that point, you should contact the insurance company to find out what inter-facility transport services are in-network, and also to make sure that the facility to which you are being transferred is in-network.

## CHARITY CARE

If you receive emergency services in an acute care hospital or a hospital satellite emergency room, you may be eligible for Charity Care even though you are insured. Acute care hospitals provide short-term medical care for sudden illnesses or injuries and typically offer a range of services, including emergency medicine, inpatient care, surgery, diagnostic testing and intensive care. New Jersey has about 72 of them. In contrast, other types of hospitals might focus on longterm care, rehabilitation or specialized areas of medicine such as cancer.

New Jersey mandates that all hospitals provide a 100% discount for residents, regardless of immigration status, with household incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty level or FPL, and discounted care for patients with household incomes between 200% and 300% of the FPL. If you are insured, Charity Care can be used to pay the portion of the hospital bill that your insurer does not pay, including co-pays and co-insurance. To determine if you are eligible for Charity Care, please consult the FPL for the current year since it is adjusted every year. This year’s FPL can be found [here](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines).

Because of the Charity Care law, a hospital cannot refuse to provide you care because of an unpaid bill for prior services. Doctors and other providers who treat you outside of a hospital context, however, are free to withhold care because of an outstanding bill.

_If you believe you are eligible for Charity Care, do not leave the hospital without an application for it_. The hospital is required to inform you of the availability of Charity Care prior to discharge (releasing you after treatment to go home or to another health care facility), and you should ask them about it if they have not done so. You have up to one year (365 days) from the date of service, or 240 days from your first post-discharge bill, to apply for Charity Care, whichever amount of time is greater.

Also, although many physicians providing emergency services at the hospital say that they do not accept Charity Care, New Jersey law requires them to do so. So, if you get a bill from a doctor who treated you on an emergency basis at a hospital and the hospital approved your Charity Care application, the doctor’s bill is invalid, and you can challenge it.

In evaluating your application for Charity Care, the hospital is entitled to ask you for certain documents to prove that you qualify based on your income and assets and also that you are a New Jersey resident, regardless of immigration status. If you do not have the necessary financial documentation, the hospital must accept a certification from you of your household monthly income. A decision on whether you qualify for Charity Care/financial assistance is supposed to be made within 10 days of when the hospital receives the complete application.

A non-profit group called [Dollar For](https://dollarfor.org/) might be able to help you with the application process. Their [website](https://dollarfor.org/) has a simple, no-cost tool that they say will provide you with a quick answer on whether you are eligible for Charity Care. You input the amount and date of the hospital bill, your household income and size, and whether or not you are insured. If the tool says you qualify, they invite you to fill out their online form and offer to prepare your application and send it to the hospital within 1 to 3 weeks. Once your application is submitted, they say they will email and text you to check in and give you tips on how to follow up and, if necessary, help you submit additional documents and prepare an appeal.

## Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund

Another possible source of assistance is the Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund (CICRF). It is a state program available to help pay expenses for New Jersey families whose children have an illness or condition where at least part of those expenses are not covered by insurance, State or Federal programs, or other sources.

The assistance is available for any type of illness so long as the costs of dealing with it are “catastrophic” for the family. There is no income requirement but the total amount of eligible medical expenses incurred in any 12-month time period must meet or exceed 10% of the first $100,000 of the family’s income, plus 15% of any additional income over $100,000.

Additional information about the Fund is available on the [website](https://www.nj.gov/humanservices/cicrf/) and it is discussed at greater length in Chapter 2, Section 4.
