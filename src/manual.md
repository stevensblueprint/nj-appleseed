      Introduction
    id: intro
    text: |      
      If you live in New Jersey, this Manual is for you. It is meant to help you and other New Jersey consumers, whether insured or uninsured, understand what your rights are when it comes to the cost of medical care and the burden of medical debt—to keep you from incurring medical debt in the first place, or help you reduce the amount of it, and to provide advice on how to deal with medical debt collectors and what to do if you are sued over a medical debt.
      
      Even if you currently have no medical debt, and have—or think you have—good health insurance, all it takes is for you or a member of your immediate family to come down with a serious illness or chronic medical condition or be injured in an accident and you might find yourself joining the ranks of the estimated 100 million Americans who owe more than $220 billion in medical debt.* In New Jersey, there are 1.5 million residents struggling with medical debt.
      
      We cover topics such as the availability of financial assistance, out-of-network charges (which can lead to surprise medical bills), how to negotiate a payment plan, a new state law that prohibits the reporting of medical debt to the credit reporting bureaus, and what you can do if a medical debt is reported in violation of the law. We even explain the basics of how to read your health insurance card so that you can better understand your coverage, how to properly read a medical bill and when your insurer denies coverage or otherwise fails to pay the appropriate benefits under your policy, how to appeal that denial. And we discuss why you might be better off not using your credit card to pay for medical debt and why you also need to be careful about using medical credit cards like CareCredit or other specialized medical credit cards.  

      **We explain it all in non-technical, easy-to-understand language.**

      Throughout this Manual, there are links to websites containing additional information or forms which those who use this Manual online or in some other digital form can click on for ready access. For those, who print out the Manual on paper and cannot make use of the hyperlinks, we have provided the URLs (Internet addresses) in Endnotes at the end of each chapter.

      The Appendix provides important forms you can use to request an itemized bill, dispute charges with a medical debt collector and respond to a legal case filed against you in court for medical debt. It contains a list of Federally Qualified Health Care Centers in New Jersey, which provide care to everyone, regardless of ability to pay. If you are uninsured, fees are charged on a sliding scale based on your income. There is also information about how to find a lawyer if you need one, and possibly free legal services if you meet the financial criteria.

      **DISCLAIMER: The information in this Manual is not legal advice. It is a source of information to help New Jerseyans deal with medical debt. For legal advice, consult an attorney.**

      Chapter 1: Rights of Insured Patients
    id: chap1
    text: |
      This chapter is for those who have health insurance of some kind – private insurance through your job or an individual policy bought on an insurance exchange, or through some public program like NJ FamilyCare, Medicaid or Medicare. Any kind of insurance is better than none, but policies differ not just in the monthly premiums you pay but also in: what benefits they provide and the scope of coverage, including the size of deductibles and co-pays; on pre-approval requirements; which providers are in or out of network; and what drugs are covered.

      ## Section 1: Understanding Your Plan—Co-pays, Co-insurance, Authorization, Appealing Denial of Benefits or Coverage

      ### YOUR ID CARD

      If you have health insurance, you should have an ID card, which contains important information about your plan. This section will help you understand what the card says and what it means or coverage under your plan.

      The information contained on the card typically includes: 
      - Your Name (or your spouse’s if you are on their employer’s plan and will likely also have the name of that employer)
      - Name of Insurance Company
      - Name and Phone Number of Primary Care Physician (PCP) if your plan requires you to have one.
      - etc...

      ### ID CARD GLOSSARY OF TERMS

      Here is what the terms mentioned above mean:

      TYPES OF PLANS

      Fully-Funded Plans (HMO. PPO, POS)—Most insurers have some sort of limitation on the health care providers you can see and still obtain insurance benefits.
      - **HMO**: The most restrictive plans are HMOs or Health Maintenance Organizations where, other than in an emergency, there is generally no coverage if you see a doctor who is outside of the insurance company’s network or not part of the HMO. You will probably have to pay the charge in full for such providers.
      - ...
      - **Medicare**: The [federal Medicare program](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title42/html/USCODE-2011-title42-chap7-subchapXVIII.htm), which covers people who are 65 or older or who have certain disabilities or conditions.
      - ...

      ### IMPORTANT PLAN TERMS
      
      **Deductibles**—A deductible is the amount the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurer is required to pay anything and it resets annually so you have to meet it again each year. There are too main types of deductibles—for in-network and for out-of- network care, usually with a separate deductible for each person covered by the plan and for a family plan, a deductible that applies to the entire family. If the deductible has not been satisfied and you incur medical charges, you have to pay the entire amount of the charge until the deductible for that year is reached (although you still get the benefit of any reduced charge that the insurance company has negotiated with the health provider for that particular type of service). Even when you have fully satisfied the in-network deductible, if you incur charges for care from an out-of-network provider, you must satisfy the out-of-network deductible separately. That is a good reason to stay in-network on top of the fact that even after the deductible is met and coverage kicks in, your insurer might cover a lower percentage of out-of-network costs—maybe 60 or 70% rather than 90%, for example.

      ***
      NOTE that deductibles do not apply to preventive testing/care, which are always covered in full, although you might be required to utilize in-network providers testing facilities or laboratories.
      ***

      **Co-Pay**—A co-pay is a set fee that you pay every time you see a doctor or other health provider or pick up a prescription. It can vary with the type of health care or the type of prescription, ranging from as low as $0 to $50 or more for a regular office visit, but usually higher for a specialist and it tends to be higher still, as much as $100 or more, for an emergency room visit. Your ID card might also specify a co-pay for Urgent Care visits, which are increasingly replacing Emergency Room visits for times when medical care is needed right away for injuries or illnesses that are not serious enough to warrant a visit to the E.R. 
      
      Under the Affordable Care Act, or ACA (also widely referred to as “Obamacare”), which became law in 2010, no co-pay whatsoever can be charged for certain types of preventive care, including vaccinations, mammograms and colonoscopies. A major caveat is that if the test is not just being done as part of regular, periodic screening, but to diagnose a suspected illness or condition, perhaps because of symptoms that are present, the testing is no longer deemed preventive and the usual deductibles and co-pays apply.

      Chapter 2: Rights of Uninsured Patients
    id: chap2
    text: |
      Without insurance, it can be difficult to get a physician to see or treat you, unless you seek services at the emergency room of an acute care hospital, where they are obligated by law to provide care. If you do not have health insurance, there are options available to you in New Jersey, where you may be able to receive affordable or even free health care as a “self-pay” patient.  Below, we will discuss options available to you.

      Chapter 3: What to Do When You Receive a Bill
    id: chap3
    text: |
      Whether or not you are insured, at some point after you receive health care services that are not fully covered by insurance or by Charity Care, you will receive a bill from the provider or providers involved in your treatment. Read below to learn how to read that bill, how to figure out if it is correct – both with regard to what it is charging you for and how much -- and, once you know how much you really owe, how to work out a payment plan with the provider so that you can pay the bill.  We will also suggest how to proceed if you cannot agree with the provider on the amount you owe, or if you disagree with a decision by your insurance company to deny coverage or erroneously treat the bill as out-of-network.

      Chapter 4: Understanding the Collection Process
    id: chap4
    text: |
      If your medical bill goes unpaid beyond its due date and if you are unable to negotiate a reasonable payment plan or you are challenging the accuracy of a medical bill, contesting the denial of benefits or the level of benefits paid by your insurance company, or simply can’t afford to pay the bill, the provider might send the bill to a collection agent, or sell your debt to a debt collection company which will try to get you to pay and sue you if you are not able to do so. Here is what you should know going forward.
