            Chapter 1: Rights of Insured Patients
      id: chap1
      text: |
            For those who have health insurance of some kind – private insurance through your job or an individual policy bought on an insurance exchange, or through some public program like NJ FamilyCare, Medicaid or Medicare, this is for you.  Any kind of insurance is better than none, but policies differ not just in the monthly premiums you pay but also in: what benefits they provide and the scope of coverage, including the size of deductibles and co-pays; on pre-approval requirements; which providers are in or out of network; and what drugs are covered.

            Chapter 2: Rights of Uninsured Patients
      id: chap2
      text: |
            Without insurance, it can be difficult to get a physician to see or treat you, unless you seek services at the emergency room of an acute care hospital, where they are obligated by law to provide care. If you do not have health insurance, there are options available to you in New Jersey, where you may be able to receive affordable or even free health care as a “self-pay” patient.  Below, we will discuss options available to you.

            Chapter 3: What to Do When You Receive a Bill
      id: chap3
      text: |
            Whether or not you are insured, at some point after you receive health care services that are not fully covered by insurance or by Charity Care, you will receive a bill from the provider or providers involved in your treatment. Read below to learn how to read that bill, how to figure out if it is correct – both with regard to what it is charging you for and how much -- and, once you know how much you really owe, how to work out a payment plan with the provider so that you can pay the bill.  We will also suggest how to proceed if you cannot agree with the provider on the amount you owe, or if you disagree with a decision by your insurance company to deny coverage or erroneously treat the bill as out-of-network.

            Chapter 4: Understanding the Collection Process
      id: chap4
      text: |
            If your medical bill goes unpaid beyond its due date and if you are unable to negotiate a reasonable payment plan or you are challenging the accuracy of a medical bill, contesting the denial of benefits or the level of benefits paid by your insurance company, or simply can’t afford to pay the bill, the provider might send the bill to a collection agent, or sell your debt to a debt collection company which will try to get you to pay and sue you if you are not able to do so. Here is what you should know going forward.
