  - content: When you seek or receive care in a nonemergency situation, always ask whether the physicians you are seeing are in your insurance network if the provider has not informed you (which they are obligated to do).

  - content: When receiving care in a hospital and you are uninsured, do not leave the hospital without first requesting (and hopefully) receiving a Charity Care application.

  - content: Do not ignore any medical bill you receive; review the bill to determine the accuracy of the bill to ensure that it contains no duplicate charges and that you received the services for which you are being billed; if you cannot pay within the time stated on the bill, enter into negotiations with the health provider to enter into a Reasonable Payment Plan based on your income.

  - content: Keep copies of all bills, any payment you make, and the terms and conditions of any Payment Plan that you negotiate with your provider.

  - content: If the bill goes into collection, do not ignore the debt collector's attempts to contact you. The debt collector is required to provide you with verification of the debt upon request. The collection agency is also required to offer you a Reasonable Payment Plan based on your income.

  - content: If you do get sued, do not ignore it.  If possible, speak with an attorney about whether you should answer, contest the bill, file for bankruptcy or take other action.
