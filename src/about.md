text: Medical debt is a growing crisis affecting millions of Americans, often pushing families into financial hardship. This website is an accessible, user-friendly place that will serve as a critical resource for New Jersey residents dealing with medical billing and debt collection. This platform will provide downloadable legal guides, sample forms, FAQs, and video tutorials to help individuals navigate medical debt disputes, insurance appeals, and payment negotiations. The site will also connect users with legal aid services and resources, making it easier for them to access the support they need. By streamlining access to this vital information, the project aims to reduce the burden of medical debt and empower individuals to protect their financial well-being. This project is a collaboration between three organizations.

      **New Jersey Appleseed Public Interest Law Center** is a nonprofit legal advocacy organization working to drive systemic change through the law. Founded in the late 1990s and rooted in a national network inspired by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and civil rights attorney Arthur Kinoy, NJ Appleseed focuses on law-based solutions—ranging from litigation and legislation to education and coalition-building. Its core advocacy areas include Empowering Voters, Health Care, Government & Corporate Accountability, and Community and Environmental Health. With a small staff, NJ Appleseed is highly effective, partnering with other public interest groups and coalitions to promote justice and equity throughout New Jersey.

      **New Jersey Citizen Action (NJCA)** is a statewide coalition and grassroots organization that fights for social, racial, and economic justice for all. NJCA combines political advocacy, electoral campaigns, public outreach, and community empowerment programs to make a real difference in the lives of everyday New Jerseyans. With this comprehensive approach, the organization addresses systemic and institutional issues as well as the pressing needs and interests of low- and moderate-income individuals across the state.

  - title: New Jersey For Health Care Coalition (NJHHC)
    body: |
      **New Jersey For Health Care Coalition** is dedicated to common sense, consumer friendly solutions to ensure every New Jerseyan can get the health care they need, when they need it, and at a price they can afford.  The coalition came together in 2008 to address the crisis of a lack of quality, affordable and accessible health coverage for our residents. Since its inception, the coalition has distinguished itself as the leading voice for consumers in federal and state health care reform efforts. Member organizations represent over two million New Jerseyans and include allied patient advocates, community and faith-based groups, labor, racial justice advocates, research and policy organizations, child, senior and women’s advocacy groups, and social service providers. Together the coalition has won important victories that have expanded coverage, increased protections and helped lower costs for patients and consumers.
