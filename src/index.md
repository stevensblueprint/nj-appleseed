      **New Jersey Appleseed Public Interest Law Center** is a nonprofit legal advocacy organization working to drive systemic change through the law. Founded in the late 1990s and rooted in a national network inspired by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and civil rights attorney Arthur Kinoy, NJ Appleseed focuses on law-based solutions—ranging from litigation and legislation to education and coalition-building. Its core advocacy areas include Empowering Voters, Health Care, Government & Corporate Accountability, and Community and Environmental Health. With a small staff, NJ Appleseed is highly effective, partnering with other public interest groups and coalitions to promote justice and equity throughout New Jersey.

  - title: New Jersey For Health Care Coalition
    body: |
      **New Jersey For Health Care Coalition** is dedicated to common sense, consumer friendly solutions to ensure every New Jerseyan can get the health care they need, when they need it, and at a price they can afford.  The coalition came together in 2008 to address the crisis of a lack of quality, affordable and accessible health coverage for our residents. Since its inception, the coalition has distinguished itself as the leading voice for consumers in federal and state health care reform efforts. Member organizations represent over two million New Jerseyans and include allied patient advocates, community and faith-based groups, labor, racial justice advocates, research and policy organizations, child, senior and women’s advocacy groups, and social service providers. Together the coalition has won important victories that have expanded coverage, increased protections and helped lower costs for patients and consumers.
